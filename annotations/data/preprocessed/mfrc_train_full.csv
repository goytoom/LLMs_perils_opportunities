Who can say? There's a lot of money behind lifting sanctions, and money talks. You can't trust the media to figure this one out.

Russia has been trying to [dodge the sanctions](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/general-electric-blackrock-implicated-in-elusive-russian-investment-fund-that-dodges-sanctions-senate-crackdown

The [TPM article](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/general-electric-blackrock-implicated-in-elusive-russian-investment-fund-that-dodges-sanctions-senate-crackdown) mentions that Russia is trying to replace Western money with Asian money, like you pointed out.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

No but seriously now. It doesn't take a genius to notice that Le Pen is anti-EU and also very right-wing (at least when it comes to foreign policy), and that people rally around *extreme* leaders when bad things happen. Nobody wants to hear ""we'll continue business as usual"" or ""let's not be hasty"" in such situations. They want fast deportations.

Whether any interested parties will/would like to actually try to make something terrible happen is a matter of debate... and my paranoia, so I'll refrain from trying to draw some objective conclusions ( ._.)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
