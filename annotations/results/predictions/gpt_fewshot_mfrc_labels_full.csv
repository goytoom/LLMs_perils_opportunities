I genuinely believe neoliberalism is beat back and wages rise and the welfare state is expanded or we find ourselves under full blown fascism. Communities of color already live under military occupation (it's how they're policed). The surveillance state is omnipresent already. Protests are already largely met with militarized police suppression. Maybe I'm just saying the masked will be lifted and the middle class will get to experience fascism too?

People who support Donald and le pen don't care about well reasoned arguments or words. They just take pleasure in using them however.  Look at their ""outrage"" over Colbert's joke.  This is from people who routinely make attack helicopter is a gender jokes.  They use whatever argument pleases them because ultimately they are hiding the true reasons they are populists: racism, emotions, etc.

If we are able to respond in kind with unserious remarks, then you have a credible way of shutting them down.
