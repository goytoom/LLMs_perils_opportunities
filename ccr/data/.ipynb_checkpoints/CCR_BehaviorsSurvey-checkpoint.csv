"My most important value is gotta be money, which guided me through each day's sex films.  On off-days, I get to utilize my money to buy all types of luxury items that I wanted, from jewelry to exotic clothing.  I could get certain handsome men to bed when I wanted as I am usually their idol.  With money, my pleasure can be served at highest, even better than the orgasm that I enjoyed while having my legs dangle in the air as I was being penetrated by these men.  Money is always power and safety as in value for me.","The past 7 days have been the same for me daily, as I wake up I get dressed in lingerie corset and high heels.  I then started my work as one of the best porn star in the state, and the whole day is just filming me doing sex with different people with different sex positions.
Ever other days I would cosplay to be different role either as a nurse, a teacher, or a prisoner.  It all plays out that I get topped by men and my clothing sometimes get ripped off of me.",3.0,2.833333333333333,2.0,2.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.833333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.1666666666666665,3.5,4.5,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,10,2.333333333333333,3.0,3.5,1,27,6,English,1,2,R_1KkkZfhTa4CERDM,0.099559166,0.11346711,0.16211535,0.19113024,0.21643583,0.18841605,0.08045032,0.04610855,0.18924806,0.04746408,0.07737819,0.13231665,0.21221814,0.229332,0.11209606,0.1422245,0.10920698,0.049751487,-0.019289147,0.039377037,0.030921387,0.025379863,0.02595966,0.07114022,0.09032729,-0.018533133,0.10296915,-0.037934646,0.023570675,0.021792665,0.12303455,0.14611097,0.06507469,0.12597546,0.02509379,0.05803506,0.089151174,0.11998457,0.075617105,0.10572325,0.11863561,0.15981773,0.16368288,0.10997996,0.12430631,0.09854001,0.12131907,0.00776615,0.19515896,0.14201939,0.10937542,0.08364733,0.2016314,0.17943369,0.14958613,0.25264907,0.16366263,0.28714204,0.23459405,0.1962803,0.10045068,0.15022466,-0.04116083,-0.0666651,-0.04200697,0.039099358,0.03597394,0.09614247,0.06250781,0.07513275,0.10422457,0.105856135,0.13810262,0.06442413,0.09127816,0.10774426,0.08757027,0.13191922,0.15143749,0.22248329,-0.049871102,-0.016138863,-7.9525635e-05,-0.0071534086,0.043579284,-0.022998797,0.0739476,0.20197128,-0.0067096837,0.049968164,0.001148982,0.04538203,0.056749407,0.1739707,0.0040865922,0.25952467,0.047430567,0.11618847
I think the most central and important values in my life are working hard and being consistent. I think that in my values I work hard to take care of my daughter and am committed to my family. These values have always been important to me. From a young age I learned that working hard is something that allows me to get ahead and achieve the goals I set out for myself. I think being consistent is the only way you make lifelong progress.  I use these to make difficult decisions because they give me the confidence to know I can make either decision and still come out ahead. I use these with my family to take care of them.,"In the past seven days I have gotten up and gotten my daughter ready for the day. I change her and get her dressed. We then eat breakfast together. Then I allow her to play on her own while I work. Some days I go to work so I drop her off at my moms. When I don't work we usually have an outing in the morning, we go shopping or to the park. Then we come home, eat lunch, and she watches her show while I work online. Then I put her down for her nap and work online some more. THen I get her up. If i'm working that day I pick her up. Then we play outside for a bit, then come inside and make dinner. We generally eat then take a bath. Then I read to her and she goes to sleep. Then I work online then hang out with my husband. Our outings this week consisted of going to a farm and the mall.",4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,5.0,11,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665,1,28,1,English,1,5,R_3rZBUUbOF4Zw4Xj,-0.027154144,-0.027022498,0.16231447,0.03675873,-0.011998422,0.07748857,-0.011338408,-0.07044727,0.006020858,0.008141026,-0.12894997,0.021491054,0.095415995,0.19086197,0.04008659,0.035170436,0.0007584626,-0.021867707,-0.09789255,-0.022592358,-0.01967195,-0.041178524,-0.013662865,0.13590248,0.014276031,-0.0032923287,0.03592261,0.038048342,-0.012533458,-0.056773864,0.059547007,0.1357764,0.026905943,0.038909346,0.027802935,-0.050471026,-0.009837957,0.032999977,-0.049055137,-0.07100734,-0.026663419,0.16618618,0.099797934,-0.0134090185,0.025264362,-0.07649031,-0.046660375,-0.01660052,-0.0024607927,0.04600413,0.015794452,-0.08400258,0.09941115,0.13637966,0.09265986,0.08531286,-0.0036995998,0.04478747,0.20235634,0.07816077,0.021330718,0.08309224,-0.10511351,-0.09869834,-0.08293981,-0.08474048,-0.07727805,-0.0077981353,0.0142147215,-0.07809836,0.022909002,-0.02357806,0.023261597,-0.033301316,-0.050311558,-0.047559883,-0.03465838,-0.096095875,-0.036371257,0.12083617,0.051586702,-0.12098374,-0.066441074,-0.02437104,-0.062272143,-0.050093308,-0.051837258,0.07187818,0.09892252,0.0354169,0.0036345012,-0.03926426,-0.089387655,-0.03644151,-0.111383446,-0.037949163,-0.13044274,0.02410477

"Avoid a black and white world view. Understand that life is shades of grey, and everyone has a reason for their actions. If someone or something tries to explain a person or event in completely black and white terms and tells you ""That's the entire story!"", be suspicious.

Strive for positivity. In today's world it's extremely easy to get mired in negativity and snark. It's not healthy; find the good in life and focus on that, bring up a smile, and try to spread that positivity around. Negativity has never helped anyone.

Honor your commitments, and be honest in all dealings. Pretty straightforward.

Stay curious. Don't simply accept things at face value; not sure what's going on with an event? Research it! See something interesting? Look into it! One of the great joys of living in this time period is access to information and knowledge.

Treat others as you'd like to be treated. This one is basically straight out of the Bible, and really doesn't need much explanation. Treat others with kindness whenever possible.

Realize that you don't have the answers, but strive for knowledge.

","'-Learning to cook. REALLY LEARN. Bake bread every day. Tweak your recipe until it becomes FANTASTIC. Make yourself a hot breakfast every morning. 
-Drawing for 10 minutes/day. There are some good internet tutorials. ---Learning to write with your non-dominant hand.
-Starting a blog. Write for 1 hour/week. Or 20 minutes/day.
-Practicing public speaking. Toastmasters has great resources online. Just grab an empty room in the library and videotape yourself. 
-Learning a language - others gave some online resources for this.
-Basic programming - codeacademy and many others available to teach you online. Even if you just spend 2 hours/weekday coding, this will really set you ahead in future opportunities/jobs.
-Exercising and jogging, did this most recently today morning. I could write for hours on exercise. Take dance lessons, or go to the salsa club with free ones. I don't care what kind of dance - ballet/modern/ballroom/whatever. The key here is regular practice. When you're good, your coordination and confidence will show in everything you do.",3.6666666666666665,3.5,3.5,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.5,3.8333333333333335,3.8333333333333335,4.0,4.5,3.6666666666666665,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,20,4.0,2.5,4.0,2,25,1,English,3,5,R_3CNNGm8ALAvSZWy,-0.061332095,0.08356053,0.16930062,0.010204691,-0.016412701,0.104445025,-0.097926594,-0.105526574,0.02239239,0.048621606,0.010602277,0.14636353,0.021260615,0.15549289,-0.0041619074,0.080113135,0.053015992,-0.0797477,-0.024932329,0.062061287,-0.02296327,-0.09782265,-0.031606168,0.07007014,-0.0065106507,-0.06700846,0.044508327,-0.09685448,-0.010999071,0.10720908,0.10363191,0.13520014,0.19568777,0.14875469,0.25375193,-0.06586419,-0.008714535,-0.08119658,-0.036470696,-0.14558208,-0.09431282,0.3373486,0.041729804,0.17915502,-0.0098594,-0.133346,-0.017932404,-0.062104877,0.19913243,0.17751905,0.033101857,-0.05099286,0.098306365,0.39551258,-0.0031158216,0.055070505,0.01175959,0.042804614,0.12134858,0.10960545,0.0884455,0.009702767,-0.0763846,-0.103781454,-0.114218,-0.10356686,-0.12798598,-0.15064807,-0.010506552,-0.07156153,-0.024845831,-0.0244329,-0.04846986,-0.09156985,-0.049108528,-0.12860191,-0.03883047,-0.1301943,-0.065308616,-0.0075628124,-0.040725484,-0.11180626,-0.03925044,-0.016265055,-0.062553585,-0.11509925,-0.09595981,0.04242888,-0.081783175,0.088042945,-0.024139252,-0.009178821,-0.1689159,-0.1050312,-0.08351979,-0.16866618,-0.11104909,-0.093691334

"I think the main values that guide me in my life all comes down to this old saying. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I try to live by this motto in nearly all my daily interactions with the people I come into contact with. If I'm driving down the road I wave at other drivers. If I'm at the grocery store or gas station I smile and am polite to the cashiers. Even at home, I try to keep the music and television at a normal volume level so as to not disturb my neighbors. I try to not gossip about other people. These are all things that I like when other people treat me this way, so I make an effort at all times to treat other people the same way.","Ok so a week ago then I suppose would have been last Friday. On Fridays I usually get up and have breakfast, check my emails, shower and get my clothes on for work. I head into work and do my daily tasks there. I work for a publishing company so much of it is just office work. However some of it is me running deliveries for any of the carriers under me that didn't get theirs done. So I get to get out of the office on a regular basis. The weekends I have off, I spend them mostly doing chores around the house and playing video games online with my friends. Monday through Thursday again are work days, so it's similar to the Friday I spoke of earlier. I'll talk more about the weekends. I like to go over to my parents house on the weekends to visit them and see some family. I try to get some rest in and sleep in.",4.5,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,4.166666666666667,3.0,5.0,5.333333333333333,4.5,5.0,1.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,17,2.333333333333333,1.0,4.0,2,39,1,English,1,3,R_3CK1yMRIn3AXDPT,0.065883055,0.036717743,0.22040507,0.04520314,0.11369859,0.22559065,0.040767066,0.050039984,0.119786516,0.09880734,0.005620731,0.09346688,0.1941947,0.27957535,0.07263218,0.09862117,0.12437536,-0.023408238,-0.028853567,-0.027760472,0.019760964,0.02153219,-0.02183542,0.056660205,0.018837195,0.077320226,0.12638512,0.068538114,0.006516763,0.06312474,0.16385603,0.22225684,0.14537095,0.15162152,0.13336594,0.00770502,0.0125862565,0.03278824,-0.0090785595,-0.019369453,-0.015274696,0.2353728,0.16503584,0.046388354,0.08709128,-0.055669058,-0.011307594,-0.04273853,0.0808806,0.10557268,0.07836215,0.04703561,0.13017018,0.2456717,0.17037266,0.2030936,0.03035935,0.15424949,0.297594,0.14050907,0.14448637,0.15684894,-0.03937325,-0.10262376,-0.0761317,-0.027361657,0.019935822,-0.004666632,-0.019365894,-0.02327624,0.006500193,-0.00369451,0.021266328,0.0065049604,0.05278778,-0.09770841,0.035791293,-0.0813865,0.035038527,0.046911884,-0.09840949,-0.09266667,-0.054883655,-0.03199576,-0.08315845,-0.04951234,-0.06329982,0.13842945,0.12002785,0.02566703,-0.08512648,-0.050955817,-0.080929056,-0.027160706,-0.094742954,0.03815814,-0.07328959,-0.060339987
"I think at the center of my life is trying to enjoy the present and be my best self. I believe in the idea that I create my life, that I write the narrative. So okay, i don't always love my job but whether or not I have a good day at work rests almost entirely on how I frame my day mentallly. I try to look at the tasks I perform as enjoyable, to see the positive in them, to take note of pleasant interactions and to see unpleasant interactions as learning experiences. And my commute is long, but I try to see it as part of my day rather than as a means to get to the next part of my day, if that makes sense - try to enjoy the commute as a time to listen to an audiobook, enjoy scenery, breathe, unwind All of the things I do, It ry to see them as positives. And I also think kindness and connections to others make it easier to live like this. Realizing that I am one of many and not the only one. I work out and meditate and take care of myself with good healthy food, and still indulge in alcohol and less healthy food too - all about finding balance and bieng in the present moment.","Starting last week, which would be Saturday I guess - so Saturday I did a lot of shopping for the house, as well as clearing out the upstairs bedrooms. We cooked breakfast and then went out to dinner, Sunday was grocery shopping for the week followed by hanging the wreath and then attending the town Christmas fair, dinner at the pub. I worked from home this week, so Monday I did a lot of school work, lesson planning, grading, and also did laundry; Tuesday was the same though also on Tuesday I sorted more boxes and brought them up to the second floor, and cleaned the downstairs bathroom and mudroom. And on Wednesday I did some online Christmas shopping and after work brought mom to Costco, and then Thursday was a very busy work day with a lot of meetings, and I also attended a webinar. Also I watched some streaming tv, and did some writing and I worked out every single day.",4.333333333333333,1.0,3.0,1.8333333333333333,2.5,2.333333333333333,3.5,3.333333333333333,4.0,4.0,5.333333333333333,2.5,3.5,4.0,5.0,5.5,6.0,4.5,20,3.333333333333333,4.0,2.833333333333333,1,51,1,English,1,6,R_5aoTZWMpCU2lVBv,-0.03219703,0.011631558,0.12092887,0.012871433,0.008831253,0.17111725,-0.011544453,0.042658404,0.06360398,0.03427696,-0.09534919,0.035562105,0.21565741,0.25871542,0.080223285,0.09668148,0.09689219,-0.045221224,-0.10091331,-0.08165039,-0.0025997702,-0.010077588,-0.07009803,0.052960865,-0.0064235916,0.06856349,0.09194994,0.04259962,-0.08928777,0.014541676,0.11584583,0.12889978,0.08992861,0.0892313,0.07205273,-0.10605793,-0.016710464,-0.046569135,-0.14488706,-0.10451011,-0.08990496,0.22327587,0.06791953,0.057034258,0.03161664,-0.07809243,0.023303756,-0.124657154,0.033751503,0.117200546,-0.051842943,-0.07529014,0.18984252,0.19544408,0.070077,0.17433658,0.06028032,0.10723854,0.25611624,0.06956771,0.08833723,0.060505144,-0.025771458,-0.06400557,-0.0847065,0.019157756,-0.029222973,-0.043042846,0.041171297,0.019597588,0.021217661,-0.008991085,0.069771424,0.024310594,0.055673584,-0.029768072,0.08482939,-0.028536756,0.022806985,0.078454114,-0.1458675,-0.12331363,-0.06784704,-0.14763305,-0.07297652,-0.09249897,-0.06665906,0.13304804,0.014399776,-0.0023426125,-0.08590349,-0.078769624,-0.11911787,-0.04115928,-0.14163068,-0.033577636,-0.12118115,-0.119348526
"I believe that acceptance is one of my core values. I accept everyone for who they are and what they look like. I teach my children that everyone is equal,even they do not act like us or look different than us. I teach them that everyone is beautiful,because that is how I feel. Another one of my values is to treat everyone with respect. I treat everyone respectfully,and I ask that I get respect in return. I always behave with kindness and compassion for everyone. Even when someone is not polite in return,I believe in  ""kill them with kindness"" ,because you do not know what someone is going through until you walk in their shoes.","This past week,I have gotten my children ready for school,pacled lunches,dressed them. I make breakfast for the family every morning. I have also fed and taken care of my dogs and cats. Everyday I clean up the house and do laundry. At night time I settle down and watch a little bit of television. On Sunday,our family attended a local amusement park and did a walk around Christmas light up festival. On Wednesday I took my children to their doctor for checkups after school. Yesterday we went out to eat after taking the children to their extra curricular activity. Today we are going to a drive through lights show. This weekend I have to start wrapping Christmas gifts.",4.833333333333333,4.0,3.5,3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,3.1666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.5,4.5,2.0,6.0,2.5,5.0,3.0,3.5,5.0,3.5,4.5,19,3.1666666666666665,4.5,3.5,1,33,1,English,1,4,R_3g5yup9a7yc5Go2,-0.002633621,0.0382801,0.11212793,-0.0017186673,0.10397113,0.17388493,0.005278996,0.1346626,0.13023049,0.17066197,0.00062927604,0.07712132,0.11113249,0.15692961,0.0053640027,0.059613124,0.055831347,-0.0016572011,-0.041248746,0.014040837,0.026098426,0.06345783,-0.048764966,-0.008041394,-0.01546883,0.116282746,0.052257467,0.09757222,0.013730248,-0.07185027,0.08868587,0.12730485,0.0683631,0.09655208,-0.02753597,-0.038971987,0.01203404,0.033108633,-0.09126103,0.010324588,-0.037351668,0.19795513,0.005673025,0.028137704,0.072089374,-0.034669474,-0.032540843,0.032150883,0.082506515,0.06105691,0.022070572,0.06409053,0.2149168,0.13806333,0.15980639,0.120629296,0.106223576,0.1603649,0.27588135,0.12168054,0.141183,0.084676065,-0.03958368,-0.02747604,0.04324653,0.06628579,0.118357904,0.04904961,0.017542748,0.015082384,0.09923707,0.0027983477,0.06817879,0.04771834,0.011946306,0.056573577,-0.017297719,0.020104151,-0.009785884,0.0853156,0.060809307,-0.019619118,0.0032132408,0.009666603,0.053765055,-0.02464806,0.0077409614,0.19649222,0.10888619,0.032653976,0.108389884,-0.037765965,0.010213066,-0.0018686652,-0.084737636,0.024279134,0.021246478,-0.013680844
"I am a follower of Jesus, so I base my values on his teachings. Jesus said that the two greatest commandments are to LOVE God with all your heart and LOVE your neighbor as yourself. He said that every other ethical principle or law can be summed up by these two. Love is the encryption key that unlocks complex problems. If I choose loving motives--those that are truly based on another's good rather than on my selfish desires--then I am at least positioning myself to navigate my way through life.","During the past 7 days, my close circle of friends and family experienced a sustained outbreak of norovirus, with violent vomiting and achy muscles that persisted for two or three days. For that reason, we all quarantined for most of that period. My wife and I cleaned the basement for an hour or so each day, sorting through old photographs and books and shredding old financial records. We took a few walks around our neighborhood, although the weather only permitted it for a few days. We ordered groceries through a delivery service on Sunday. I ran practice 5Ks every other day, with a 5-miler on Sunday. Most days my wife and I read scriptures and watched instructional videos in the evenings. Last night we finally felt clear to have our neighbors across the street over for dinner. We played a child-friendly game with them and their three-year old.",4.833333333333333,1.0,4.333333333333333,2.5,3.0,4.166666666666667,2.5,5.0,3.5,2.0,5.333333333333333,2.0,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,22,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.333333333333333,2,63,1,English,1,7,R_2E4czvZ0BYjjgNk,0.02489283,0.08500551,0.07293384,0.06048514,0.11168006,0.17702577,0.055017944,0.13992773,0.115639105,0.08760407,0.009627525,0.08228193,0.21528919,0.29574704,0.16721253,0.12736553,0.15399438,0.09823249,-0.024536422,0.08546981,0.084665924,0.031294383,0.090897694,0.079994276,0.035959896,0.009022789,0.044076897,0.14142616,0.012425965,-0.060617145,0.16705918,0.100383624,0.06618251,0.07117196,-0.04115592,0.16203204,0.11373435,0.15996802,0.073141664,0.1509257,0.13343157,0.07103419,0.01275639,-0.010796516,0.08610937,0.08909449,0.052181512,0.17751968,0.03543561,0.071459666,0.22477637,0.21038142,0.067916654,0.07644755,0.21372123,0.20891371,0.06537688,0.14344321,0.21704555,0.018362269,0.16790181,0.06430736,0.23182291,0.13916942,0.13252383,0.22185862,0.2041876,0.1542786,0.02670002,0.06336343,0.11936748,0.06761558,0.026491506,0.028688151,-0.008612489,0.007856105,-0.018839464,-0.04269103,0.0222088,0.10071432,0.034900427,-0.04426494,0.0927826,0.087082066,-0.034286648,0.025058476,0.015959783,0.15375312,0.112679765,0.18349966,0.09838507,0.05291576,0.1753239,0.036039684,0.079937026,0.16374674,0.11057981,0.03605079
"My most important values are kindness, respect, and truth. It is sometimes hard to find what is true or not, but I think it can be found with kindness and respect in tow. These values guide my decisions and actions as best I can. I think this helps me live a good life and blesses those around me.","I have done a lot over the last week.

I did a new workout. I went to church but didn't stay the whole time. I learned something new with our business and earned the top spot in my Duolingo language lessons.

"I think a central value for me is simplicity. I try very hard to not consume too much whether it is possessions, food, energy or the time and attention of either my mind or of others. I work hard to find pleasure in simple things that I have overlooked in the past: being alive, drinking a glass of water, eating food and exercise. In this way, when unusual and pleasureable things do happen: a new pair of earrings, a nice meal at a restaurant, I really enjoy them as I do not indulge in them often.

A second important value for me is pay attention to where I am and one important secondary value related to this is to be outside and be aware of the natural world. Being in nature helps me be present. 

","In the past 7 days I ran errands, specifically last weekend, including going to a home improvement store to buy caulk and to the local post office to mail a package. I also visited the local library to try and find a new Agatha Christie book to read. These activities happen weekly, usually. 
I also engaged in the usual daily tasks such as waking up, drinking coffee, making the bed, having breakfast (a bagel, quite often) and doing some work. Three times I went for a vigorous walk or an easy jog. I prepared dinner and did a winding down practice before bed each day consisting of yoga and a meditation.

"One value I try to stand by is being truthful in all aspects of my life.  That means always been truthful to others and to myself.  Even when things go poorly or I don't accomplish something I need to I try to let in people close to me and discuss these issues.  I also try to be productive every day.  I want to feel accomplished in my life, and that means I need to stay on task and accomplish goals.  I push myself to be productive even when I do not want to be because it adds value to my life.  Having rewarding experiences is another goal of mine.  This is valuable because it is what life is all about.  When combining being truthful and productive the next step is applying these to life.  Whether that is vacations, adventures, or goals these can all ultimately be rewarding.  I want to do this because when I am older I want to be able to look back on my life with pride and know that I did not waste the time I had.  All of these values are very important and I always have them in the back of my mind.","My past week has been spent doing normal activities along with some irregular tasks.  Last Friday my fiance and I went to her company Christmas party and a concert.  Over the weekend we worked on house projects and cooked some good dinners.  On Sunday I went for a run and watched the Packers.  After that I wrapped some Christmas presents and then we ate pizza.  Monday morning I got up for work, and started my normal week.  That included making my breakfast and coffee then going to the office.  Then was busy at work until the afternoon.  I went home and went for a run then answered some emails and made dinner.  After dinner we watched some tv and then went to bed.  On Tuesday and Wednesday I had very similar days.  I had my normal work days followed by workouts, dinner, and then catching up on my reading before bed.  Yesterday I went to work, worked out, and then went out to dinner for chicken wings and beers with friends.

"A value is what is considered important in life, what makes life worth living. A values is also something that help us decide what is right or wrong in moral term.

Purity, piety, meditation, self-discipline, self-control, devotion to god can be consider as spiritual values. Cultural values allows us to situate ourselves in relation to the society we live in.

All these values are important in life to achieve success and live healthy, happily, trusty.

Personally I practice four values in life.

Health is the greatest gift,
Contentment is the greatest wealth,
Trust is the best relative,
Liberated mind is the greatest bliss.

I gained health & happiness by following things in life.

Anybody can accept and practice three values Respect, Friendship and Excellence under any circumstance.","Respect is different kinds. Respect for yourself, respect for others, respect for rules, respect for life, respect for the environment and many more. Basically respect for everything. respect is kind of business. If you respect somebody or something we are receiving respect. We can’t expect respect from somebody without giving respect.

Friendship is really important to make good and healthy relationships. Healthy relationship important to success life. We can’t do anything alone. We need support of others’. So that everybody should realize and know how to make healthy relationships.

Excellence is the third important value for life. There are different kinds of excellence like personal excellence.",4.666666666666667,4.166666666666667,4.666666666666667,4.833333333333333,4.166666666666667,4.5,4.833333333333333,4.833333333333333,5.5,5.5,5.666666666666668,5.5,6.0,5.5,5.0,5.0,5.5,5.5,26,5.0,1.0,4.833333333333333,1,54,1,ENGLISH,1,6,R_BLBLKhyl1SCBQCR,0.28166255,0.3983814,0.09079138,0.08636749,0.18764347,0.10497297,0.18097636,0.16663207,0.11604388,0.18366602,0.06775484,0.2631247,0.07378983,0.13609421,0.09481999,0.1070824,0.14590293,0.009596973,-0.05743017,0.09941119,0.21754183,-0.017876204,0.010486666,0.19532515,0.30313978,0.113940775,0.19396801,0.12729871,0.1761621,0.003482257,0.111657664,-0.020434182,-0.006214015,0.023598772,0.061389025,0.2325792,0.2775747,0.21927613,0.19244581,0.18050367,0.27043888,0.047465347,0.14822961,0.22622396,0.72449017,0.3462544,0.2153067,0.16555277,0.3892762,0.28968045,0.20064074,0.12751877,-0.021014044,0.035559513,0.2753169,0.39074472,0.39358583,0.39085823,0.18578884,0.28041023,0.14344998,0.36282322,0.41469538,0.3473571,0.20501429,0.20877482,0.15435876,0.13317618,0.14031163,0.05248955,0.208965,0.14988522,0.27308592,0.03649026,0.049506523,0.18670374,0.07709685,0.2041918,0.32579327,0.18547852,0.10261123,0.094928525,0.20478785,0.08129238,0.18256946,0.32540923,0.36898172,0.42055154,0.41659197,0.2257989,0.45175743,0.348929,0.17132708,0.37675554,0.078015134,0.06890051,0.03742512,0.23483151
"The most important values to me is kindness and good will. I think that being good to each other is the best thing that we can do. I firmly believe in considering other people's well-being first and being as good of a person that you can be. I think that being non-judgmental and assuming the best about people is also very important as a guiding principle in my life. I have had the same life principals since I was a child, really. I have always asked the ""what-ifs,"" like maybe that person is having a bad day and that's why they acted in that way.","Every morning of the past week has been the same: I get up and get my self ready for the day. I start the pot of coffee that has been prepped the day before. I start my shower. I get my makeup on and then I drink my coffee while I look at my phone, check my emails, check my social media. Each day, I woke my son up at 6:45am so that he can get ready for school. I start his day by making him breakfast, usually either cereal or pancakes. I brush his teeth after breakfast and then I get him dressed. I take him outside and put him on the bus to school. Almost always, I come inside and work on Mturk for a few hours. After that bit of work, I start doing my chores. I switch the laundry, empty the dishwasher. This week my dog went to the vet, where we found out that he has an ear infection, so I have been cleaning his ears and applying medication to them every day this week. My son comes home from school each day at 3;45, at which time I make dinner. This week I made pizza on Monday and Tuesday, I made shrimp scampi pasta on Wednesday, I made broccoli and cheese soup for Thursday. I made a dessert this week which we have enjoyed over the week, it was Nutella blondies.",4.833333333333333,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.6666666666666667,1.0,4.166666666666667,3.6666666666666665,6.0,2.0,6.0,1.5,5.5,6.0,3.0,3.5,5.5,6.0,5,3.5,1.0,3.0,1,32,6,English,1,3,R_2VdQAnpE9RmNo8c,-0.049368586,-0.023705233,0.10980634,0.038023297,-0.02249335,0.088339776,-0.08641525,-0.07968481,0.022600576,-0.0038047358,-0.12358894,-0.025864132,0.105923,0.19395676,0.07694121,0.091209166,0.06371291,0.012461729,-0.06994526,-0.01637851,0.012792837,-0.01713741,-0.05317737,-0.017730162,-0.035003964,0.060139593,0.06852729,0.07942888,-0.027626399,-0.03510279,0.06569975,0.08172456,0.03919645,0.09444956,0.06641624,-0.12271538,-0.04134082,0.007739273,-0.108645245,-0.09264054,-0.07380988,0.18393621,0.02663424,0.0043136626,0.0015565977,-0.06334096,-0.032016035,-0.04810687,-0.015615147,0.056274243,-0.06933745,-0.051287368,0.03669313,0.084514044,0.05989466,0.13833326,-0.03704737,0.051418874,0.18886712,0.008370556,0.041939817,0.0200614,-0.08256456,-0.039291598,-0.05701007,-0.05328062,0.03977978,0.007525321,0.008162221,-0.033620805,0.061847854,-0.065854326,0.01694871,-0.010227378,0.010290965,0.030929543,0.010334366,-0.07125045,0.0067236945,0.069763735,0.04822558,-0.10982913,-0.03219857,-0.04466088,-0.049496397,-0.10129024,-0.105325356,0.04534679,0.102953635,0.026289625,0.027789794,-0.018789042,-0.019339252,-0.056769475,-0.09731152,-0.0965454,-0.016185105,-0.10132016

Yet,  have found my justification and loveliness in Jesus. This relationship guides my honesty, in that I can own my failures and speak truth to those around me as Jesus covers me in his beauty, not that others find me lovely. That my sexuality can be controlled because I do not need someone to make me feel wanted or desirable, I am found desirable by Jesus even before I start my day. I do not need to pursue wealth with every fiber of my being because it can never provide the security I find in Jesus, he also redeems my efforts and grants me creativity to provide the resources I need. Thusly, we are one in the same, Jesus and I.","I have gone to work each of the last five days. Usually this involved preparing my breakfast and eating eat with the children. While eating we would discuss the days activities and expectations. We would conduct some bible reading and prepare our hearts for the day. We then would get moving out the door. On Wednesday I deviated from this task of getting to work and drove to get my covid booster shot. This was uneventful but fulfilling in my civic duties. Each of the five nights we have conducted our advent activities by either enjoying certain foods, painting hand made crafts, or singing songs. Last nights song was quite enjoyable, a song about a manger, as the children joined in with much joy. Saturday and Sunday, the two days prior to the past week, involved visiting with our Grandfather and going to church. These were fulfilling in their own right as with Grandpa we made christmas cookies. At church we worshipped and visited together per usual.",4.833333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.1666666666666665,2.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.1666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,5.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,6.0,2.5,6.0,27,3.6666666666666665,3.0,2.833333333333333,2,38,1,English,1,5,R_yvVm8a9lHzBKl9L,0.108725004,0.25776964,0.17035052,0.13122547,0.1815074,0.2974265,0.18992248,0.2693832,0.24528982,0.21703133,0.07446359,0.28421175,0.42025352,0.47957423,0.2674312,0.2710107,0.29372233,0.087593876,-0.012419656,0.07164399,0.2218422,0.08228889,0.027885575,0.22539541,0.2171434,0.111921966,0.15524787,0.18506373,0.0865033,0.033113535,0.25046426,0.24757478,0.21631855,0.20323381,0.16586238,0.08021896,0.17802376,0.10794305,0.024726313,0.04894403,0.06590054,0.24200512,0.17022869,0.10775839,0.20423906,0.07084139,0.14476098,0.13392085,0.24084567,0.25633603,0.107595354,0.099945724,0.21757042,0.24919426,0.20983705,0.29311758,0.2600171,0.37049866,0.31689206,0.23566747,0.19291973,0.13444358,0.20084351,0.14627603,0.08826818,0.1759085,0.16156003,0.12695207,0.06180074,0.107196726,0.15065184,0.1092976,0.22191365,0.033611245,0.10423889,0.12830591,0.12168938,0.11604311,0.13211428,0.09006189,0.052430827,0.014662802,0.065019086,-0.009883234,0.013924291,0.023649959,0.21501483,0.41998777,0.23187247,0.26557827,0.17895722,0.12146876,0.14595371,0.10272009,-0.081404224,0.06533048,0.023844332,0.05815692
"I treat others as I would want to be treated. I treat everyone I realistically can as good as possible, as that's how I would like to be treated. Why be mean or rude to anyone if it's not needed? I try to rise above adversity and just choose kindness. I feel like it's benefited my friends, as we maintain a good relationship.

"The most important value that I have is autonomy. I want to be able to make my own choices. I want it to be my body and my choice. I want to decide for myself what is best. I want to live the lifestyle that I want because I want it and not have to answer to anyone. I want to read a book because I want to and not be shamed for it. I want to eat what I want to and not be judged. I want to believe what I want to believe and not be attacked for it. I want to be myself. I want to purchase the things I want to purchase and not have someone always looking over my shoulder or ""being on their radar"" and secretly making judgments about me that I am not adult enough or that I am to childish because I like to wear things with hearts or because I like to watch films on Disney Plus, or that I love to read books about fantasy worlds. The things that matters the most to me is that I can truly be myself in my relationships and not be shamed all the time because it doesn't look like what another person thinks is good for me. We are not all the same. We don't all want the same things. We should be free to love what we love and not have to defend it all the time. Who cares if it doesn't look like you? I am my own person. I have my own mind and my own beliefs. I don't have to be a cut out of another person. I don't care what another person believes is acceptable. I don't care what another person believes my faith should be. The most important thing to me is my autonomy. I am sick and tired of being treated like a child and watching the world treat grown adults like children who can not decide for themselves what they want to do with their own body. Our body is ours. It is not something that should ever be ""owned"" by someone else. No one should be able to tell me what I can and cannot do with my own body.","I watch videos on BookTube. I take studies on Amazon Mturk. I wash dishes, sweep the floor, and clean up the kitchen. I take care of my parent's cats.  I baked toffee bars the other day. I like to listen to music on Pandora.

"My number one most important aspect of my life is my family, particularly my grandchildren. I am old and get grouchy easy and tired easy, but I try hard to make sure I don't allow this to effect them. I try to make sure they have days filled with laughter and smiles. I take this money I get from doing hits and buy my babies presents here and there through out the year (not just bdays and christmas), I also use the money to make sure I have cookies and healthy snacks for them to always have on hand. I worked ALL the time raising my sons as a single mother, I miss too much of their childhoods to ever be able to come to terms with it. I put all that I missed into my grandchildren, I don't want to miss a thing.","My days consist of a morning routine. I get up at 6 feed and water the dog. Then I start my coffee and feed and water the cat. When the coffee is done I let both animals out and I sit on patio to have my coffee and cigarettes, yes I am still in my pjs. After my coffee I bring in the dog, get dressed and begin sweeping and vacuuming the floors. At about the time I am finishing up my youngest (2) grandchild is brought over for me to watch. (they live next door)I teach her the abc's numbers, counting etc...then she plays in the same room as me while I try to do some 'hits' on here. At about 11:30 she is fed lunch and is down for nap at noon. I take a shower (if I didn't the night before)and I enjoy the peace and quiet. At 2pm I leave to pick my grandkids up from school, once home the baby is woken up from nap. The kids play outside for about an hour, then come in and do homework, after that they do some fun creative art I have ready for them. I start dinner around 4 and it is ready 5-5:30.

"My core values depend on a lot of different aspects of my life.  When I was still working, I only took jobs where I was really behind the company and the products or services that it offered.  I found through a couple of bad experiences, that working for a place that I didn't believe in made it very hard to continue employment with them.
Other core values that are important to me is to be honest with myself.  If I'm not honest with myself than I can't be honest with others that I interact with.
I always try to help others when they ask and I like to be able to solve problems for people when I can.","I usually have quite a routine from week to week.  Bing in the first year of full retirement, I try to keep myself actively exercising 6 days a week by biking for and hour in the morning right after I get up.  I find that doing my cycling first thing in the morning, it gets it out of the way so that I can have the rest of the day free and if I'm riding outside during nice weather I can have the streets to myself.
After my exercising, I get back to my desk and work on the computer reading e-mail.  After a cup of coffee or two, I head to the shower and have breakfast after that.  
I start doing surveys and then have lunch.  After lunch I have a quick nap and finish out the afternoon with more surveys.  At 4PM I start ""Happy Hour"" and then have dinner, watch TV and retire for the evening around 10PM.  
The above is my activity for most of the week, unless we are traveling.

"I find my relationship with God is the most important value. I am trying to find my way back to God. I want to experience God in all ways. I want the honesty in it. I want the independence and freedom God provides. I am manifesting my reality and I want to do it more consciously. 
My deepest value is to commit my life to that more and more. That can be through practice. That can be through self care. That can be through my family. That can be through my community. Everything is God so I can interact with it always. I think it is a simple way to approach life and I find it rewarding already so I keep doing it.","I have worked all week. I even pulled extra shifts over the weekend so Sunday I rested. I read books. I played games with my family. I cooked and cleaned. It was a rest day. Since then I go to work after prayer everyday.  I then come home and cook can clean with my wife. I also had intention group Monday. On Thursday I also had a money management meeting. It has been a fairly simple week, Just going to work and then being with my family. 
I love weeks like this. Work has been difficult and very busy. So coming home to simple routines I have found that is restful.

"My faith in God is the most important aspect of my life.  Thus, values like honesty, love, and kindness are extremely important.  I want everyone I encounter to see the joy and light of Christ when they meet me.  I want to spread love everywhere I go.  I try to be honest and kind to everyone, even with those whom it is difficult to show love to.  When making major decisions, I pray to God asking for His discernment and then I try to feel peace with whatever decision I think He is pushing me toward.  I don't always succeed at this, but I try my hardest.","Last Friday I drove to my friend Gabriella's house so our sons could play together.   She lives 1.5 hours away, so a lot of time was spent in the car.  Last Saturday I spent time with my son and husband.  Last Sunday was church and we got takeout for dinner.  Every morning I made eggs and oatmeal for breakfast.  Every afternoon we went to the playground.  My son had a 2 hour nap every day from around 10:30am to 12pm.  I made dinner each night.  I prayed my consecration to St. Joseph every day.  Thursday I went for a 4 mile run while my husband played with our son.

"My belief in family drives most of what I do each day.  I put myself before others and try to serve instead of take.  It is not always easy, but then that is where my Christian beliefs also guide and motivate.  I was taught those beliefs from my father and mother and extended family, so here we are back to family again.  I could name specific values, but really I am guided fundamentally by those family roots.  If something seems right or wrong, it is most likely a reflection or extension of that heritage.  And if I had to list a few of those guiding values, it would be the classic list we teach: love joy patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control.  If these are in my heart, it is going to be a good day.","Here we go: doing dishes, working on my laptop, running, making breakfast lunch and dinner, riding my bike, giving hugs, making a sketch of a never-ending triangle, helping littles understand right from wrong, sledding, watching a movie, throwing a toy for the dog, buying groceries, helping meal plan, doing a dumbbell workout, playing with clay, taking a picture of the moon, taking shelter from a strong storm.",3.5,2.0,4.166666666666667,4.5,4.0,4.166666666666667,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.5,6.0,2.0,4.0,18,2.6666666666666665,5.0,4.5,2,54,1,English,1,5,R_1NsEvEbl3lzlOuZ,0.029850636,0.15916517,0.13421398,0.16514136,0.047833703,0.19733289,0.04787387,0.09924557,0.14833382,0.24923019,0.072489895,0.1843126,0.16943604,0.32847252,0.16557449,0.099188864,0.062578306,0.043983396,0.0398995,0.08460392,0.15058294,0.21251939,-0.024539862,0.040795557,0.062181316,0.13686487,0.19403374,0.13374725,0.075586125,0.05162745,0.24006546,0.22137922,0.15969723,0.3403917,0.21829845,-0.03147729,0.025340555,0.0033077952,0.0010537114,-0.13082683,-0.045013685,0.3373716,0.10056471,0.25560823,0.09872029,0.04604524,0.08213549,0.16364673,0.2097449,0.27865797,0.14455315,0.14202982,0.24240403,0.35588098,0.05355445,0.18519256,0.1508311,0.14604369,0.32032984,0.33345377,0.34929755,0.12175466,0.09808074,0.11898601,0.13813424,0.104820035,0.1575491,0.084747076,0.15904626,0.12071723,0.18263124,0.13229336,0.16441867,0.018625591,0.12714902,0.11499478,0.060341958,0.11721897,0.068134904,0.14904788,0.00888305,-0.03664396,0.094070286,0.017617716,0.03132318,-0.012766771,0.07198972,0.17738405,0.052736305,0.12782699,0.031951655,0.02835379,0.10298946,0.013994938,-0.0975753,-0.044208158,0.042049404,0.06901419
"The way I try to live my life I guess would be explained that I sort of believe in karma. I try and treat people the way I'd like to be treated, even though I sometimes lose track of that. I try to place myself in other's shoes and see things from their angle, try to imagine that they are going through a hard time and need some grace. I guess I feel like I will be rewarded at some point for living this way.

When making decisions I try to use what my head says over what my heart wants and I try to impart this wisdom to my children. Even though time feels like it is rushing by I like to take my time on things.","In the past seven days I've visited a friend at his home in Tennessee. This friend is my golfing buddy and he is in hospice. I've been to a Christmas party where I wore the same ugly Christmas sweater I wear every year. I've been to the gym 4 times and did a mix of free weights and stair climbing. I took my son to college to take exams. I've done a myriad number of tasks around the house including going to work three days out of this week. I took my Springer Spaniel to the groomer yesterday and watch him shake slightly as he exited my car. I've cooked dinner three nights this week and taken my daughter to her counseling session. Today I've picked up groceries and folded laundry and gave my wife an early Christmas present, a Christmas gnome. No sense in getting a Christmas decoration the day of Christmas when you have to wait 300 plus days to display it. I've also worked on Mturk 3 days this week when time has permitted.",4.0,1.0,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,4.0,2.6666666666666665,4.5,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.5,4.5,2.5,4.5,5.5,4.0,4.5,15,2.833333333333333,4.5,3.5,2,50,1,English,1,6,R_29uIiOQ6VYW3jQs,-0.02282521,0.006208945,0.07647439,-0.0027623316,0.024524761,0.2012775,-0.045115646,0.06025563,0.052868243,0.064442314,-0.12770359,-0.008561537,0.07541109,0.13012329,0.041681163,0.005873468,0.05207708,0.06276727,-0.033626433,-0.027526187,0.027127512,0.09677271,0.055491343,0.07270713,0.06942451,0.09327294,0.03975703,0.07682958,0.016234063,-0.063632965,0.06163778,0.12164657,0.09871788,0.023662355,-0.0058686454,-0.043045036,0.013190541,0.049161423,-0.07429454,0.055375718,-0.04911512,0.14567462,0.038569976,-0.031092867,0.033993624,-0.1090457,-0.07639699,-0.039374605,-0.0021600835,0.01964407,-0.03533044,-0.027863087,0.2016273,0.05791954,0.106443025,0.09790274,0.10097475,0.1343324,0.22960976,0.03642971,0.048889454,0.0412087,0.07579982,0.04059998,0.058782063,0.09384215,0.14522848,0.11141178,0.0125087295,0.0037858589,0.04771197,0.023756526,0.12421414,0.04947429,0.015433259,0.03783387,0.036541313,0.042147394,0.02083196,0.06909779,-0.06618148,-0.044651538,-0.028509265,-0.08404826,0.010872036,-0.013966548,0.019771459,0.19042525,0.0822851,0.056405254,-0.00795079,-0.04324365,0.04286406,0.008405633,-0.035663217,0.07701421,-0.009015611,-0.03843559
"I try to live my life based on the principle of ""live and let live"". If someone is doing something that does not directly interfere with myself or others, I see no harm in it. This for me means that I do not put much worth in things like the ""traditional family"" or gender roles, and I believe that everyone should pursue their own happiness. I base a large amount of my beliefs on answering two questions: does this action harm the person doing it? Does this action harm others? As long as the answer to both of those questions is no, I see no issue with the activity, even if it is unusual or otherwise outside of the societal norm. When it comes to deciding between two choices, this also comes into play for me. I consider whether one of the choices would do harm to me or others, and if not, I choose the one that feels like it would do the most good for myself and others. This is a simple system, but I believe it has made me a happier person and has takes some stress out of my life.","Over the past week I have done mainly routine things. I started off the week by going grocery shopping on Sunday. Aside from that I woke up at around 7 each day, I made breakfast, and started on work. I ate lunch between 11:30 and 12:30, and then either continued work or continued on another project through the afternoon. Dinner typically got cooked at around 6 this week, and after that I did the dishes and worked on some other housekeeping. Since it is close to Christmas, I took some time out of each evening to work on wrapping gifts and getting them ready for their recipients. I also have a cross stitch project that I finished Thursday, so I took some time out of my evening to get it washed and hung up to dry.",4.833333333333333,3.5,2.0,3.0,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,4.0,3.8333333333333335,6.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.5,6.0,4.5,6.0,5.5,6.0,5,3.6666666666666665,1.0,3.6666666666666665,1,23,6,english,1,4,R_xsau32MBVMRBPA5,-0.021892678,0.027233735,0.10502954,0.09157955,0.04146809,0.16224125,-0.017895043,0.029839978,0.10195292,0.036324773,-0.04410839,0.036066912,0.16764651,0.23379673,0.03981896,0.082706705,0.07973926,-0.010796716,-0.084477395,0.0033175722,0.01241785,-0.0022969022,-0.024923638,0.033426512,0.008108855,0.07437692,0.12102761,-0.0005790256,-0.04477686,0.017860264,0.110079974,0.078311265,0.07634613,0.18980944,0.08416361,-0.08056905,-0.0038095098,-0.08030716,-0.14438497,-0.11924687,-0.053280644,0.23780125,0.034491424,0.034660585,0.02863141,-0.074138224,-0.014980545,-0.07420728,0.05809754,0.15299352,-0.073540285,-0.033739716,0.22014275,0.09489255,0.02642061,0.19027545,0.09456864,0.1356587,0.29578495,0.07486193,0.12033138,0.03415306,-0.0038730334,-0.016642554,-0.052058395,0.032861,0.077988,0.007513861,-0.029639015,0.0014137849,0.045007568,-0.0103324875,0.10505669,-0.004889963,0.122325495,0.011123434,0.111660056,0.0034570806,0.06155649,0.07519017,-0.1582703,-0.08585567,-0.08324024,-0.04536206,-0.024837991,-0.079605214,-0.025837088,0.16343254,-0.04913318,-0.0309189,-0.14846197,-0.04724333,-0.06895457,-0.050501537,-0.15543295,0.0018598214,-0.03585494,-0.061783917
"Wow my values were instilled in me when I was a young girl. My parents taught me morals and values that have stayed with me my entire life. This topic brings tears to my eyes after what I just wrote because it is those, we love so much that are no longer here that we learned from and have instilled in us life lessons that will never leave us on this earth. I try to teach my son these same exact values and I am proud to see him become the man that I trained early on like my parents trained me. We are old fashioned, and I don't care those folks may call me that because I would take old fashioned any day then what I hear and see around me in today society. It is truly sad. I appreciate my upbringing even in the hardest of times because it taught me so many life values and principles. For sure.",Well for the most part I am a homebody and there is always so much to do at home I never get bored. I started my week off with a big grocery trip to buy stuff for baking Christmas cookies and cakes. I also did alot of online shopping towards the middle of the week I took down my old jacuzzi tub and put up a new one for myself. Now that took a good part of 2 days to do with help from my son. It is inflatable but still takes time to do. I was proud of myself when it was all done. I then had to find my Christmas lights and try to decorate the tree that is not even done as of this date. There is only so many hours in a day and then have to play with the dog and take him out etc. Cook clean and always doing something around the house keeps me busy and some days I just want to lay down and watch tv all day but that is not an option in my life or so it seems. I do alot of praying each day and thinking this holiday is sad without my Mother who we lost this year. I lost my brother last year so holidays are very rough for me now. I try to be positive for my son though who also shares a Christmas Eve birthday. I think alot as I go about my daily chores and try to always remember and pray every day about all the beautiful memories my Mother and Brother and my Father who is no longer here as well gave to me. Life is not the same for sure and if I think too much on it it really makes me sad. They would not want me to be sad this I know. But it is hard not to be especially this time of year.,5.0,3.6666666666666665,4.5,5.0,4.833333333333333,4.5,4.166666666666667,4.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,5.5,22,3.333333333333333,7.0,3.8333333333333335,1,64,1,English,1,3,R_301v1abxtmmI27i,-0.08325299,0.08199174,0.11780203,0.0658884,0.046923995,0.22574505,-0.063073955,0.044637512,0.12569092,0.06660156,-0.041184716,0.13469492,0.10383545,0.27410847,0.10879685,0.15415633,0.21902879,0.017285,-0.07186763,-0.034579087,0.08000426,0.017388668,-0.03180003,0.025755852,-0.017482968,0.077797085,0.057244323,0.07130742,-0.008230975,0.025159726,0.11174779,0.25436622,0.1945543,0.13580257,0.17379037,-0.1116166,-0.025842229,-0.08888173,-0.099011615,-0.11083184,-0.13452485,0.27548087,0.08543733,0.11367779,0.029587142,-0.05971418,0.00576955,0.0798803,0.11406827,0.099785216,0.015058346,-0.031018786,0.18368405,0.30219787,0.07650258,0.13678643,0.06897455,0.10516669,0.2836672,0.15644458,0.09234521,0.032419544,0.077176966,0.032316104,0.07032199,0.09534131,0.112338126,0.07312874,0.05972398,0.01898104,0.11195602,0.012478065,0.07724912,0.045615613,0.03736383,0.031112222,-0.05015292,0.0030135773,-0.00332773,0.059318915,-0.09116386,-0.05085709,0.04170167,-0.09254264,0.014838288,-0.053657975,-0.0052782996,0.16918582,0.06304421,0.123061225,-0.06687101,-0.036357418,-0.0045988522,-0.0074887173,-0.115661904,-0.07788436,-0.0063967584,-0.08618212

"Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work. They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to. 
Love, Freedom and Family are three important values in my life. And the major guidelines i use to keep the values are honesty, hard Work, confidence, perseverance.","The past seven days have been so fun for me and my family.

"Above all else, I value loyalty. I strongly believe that you truly discover who your true friends are when you encounter a moment of need. If I am in a difficult situation, which rarely happens, I judge my family and friends on how they respond to my need(s) during this period. To be honest, I also judge myself the same way. When my family or friends are in need, I expect myself to assist them in any manner possible. If I don't, I don't consider myself worthy of their love and respect. 

Another important value that guides my life is honesty. If someone won't be honest with you, why in the world would you allow them to continue to be a part of your life? I understand that you can certainly encounter dishonest people that you have no control over, such as people at stores or businesses and work colleagues. Much like loyalty, however, I tend to judge people pretty quickly. If they show themselves to be dishonest in any way, I keep them at a distance or cut them out of my life entirely.","Much of the time I've spent during the past week is very mundane and redundant. I am a creature of habit and enjoy a predictable and well-structured life. 

Last weekend, I spent with my son, who I see every other weekend. We sat around and watched a lot of horror movies, as that's kind of our bonding activity now, since he is a teenager. We ate out a couple of times, fast food one day and pizza another. We also did some necessary chores around my apartment and played a couple of video games together. 

During the last 5 days of my work week, my days don't vary much. I get up, eat a keto-friendly breakfast. Work from home, in my den, until noon. I then go for a 3 mile run at lunch. After lunch, I drink a keto lunch-replacement shake and then work all afternoon. After work, I usually spend about 30 minutes doing resistance exercises. I then eat a healthy dinner. After dinner, I clean the dishes, play some piano, as I'm taking lessons, and then sit and watch TV until I go to bed. I'm usually texting with friends and playing on social media a bit in the evenings as well.",3.0,1.1666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,1.5,4.166666666666667,2.6666666666666665,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.5,4.0,5.0,17,2.6666666666666665,5.5,3.8333333333333335,2,42,1,English,1,5,R_1PSG1diW58kFm7D,0.05569141,0.101023495,0.16421402,0.15513998,0.08236532,0.18845265,0.015364673,0.0031001028,0.13616952,0.123462856,-0.021857942,0.0861823,0.1859335,0.32059062,0.11743681,0.12675971,0.100400835,-0.07039876,-0.082865864,-0.017534157,-0.012287017,-0.029369568,-0.06347518,0.035877414,0.03116812,0.05643805,0.022316948,0.0020858878,0.023242539,-0.026004089,0.12622137,0.18112904,0.104551286,0.1175058,0.11269762,-0.044733293,-0.0026418567,-0.014038936,-0.053510617,-0.077690005,-0.010055687,0.25321084,0.1322371,0.08954253,0.06102696,-0.031295583,-0.011810587,0.06124581,0.09076159,0.16225734,0.05006623,0.0022916365,0.07498662,0.24098605,0.101642326,0.23596948,0.07758096,0.13394023,0.30902007,0.14923686,0.10837692,0.14442953,-0.0031970367,0.0017605152,0.0026590396,0.009551747,0.0484593,0.07781331,-0.013998954,0.0029353518,0.10611763,0.041971028,0.102850944,-0.03352531,0.08294128,0.016798934,0.013719042,-0.042280424,0.06532329,0.08620179,-0.053827897,-0.11780908,-0.043525934,-0.049599178,-0.011361249,0.008659303,-0.010714763,0.14045592,0.10555485,-0.029728947,-0.05603356,0.03544314,-0.016826417,-0.053464334,-0.10330254,-0.051330037,0.0095813805,-0.031471632
"Some of the most important values that guide my life have changed over time and some have been constant. I completely believe in the importance of honesty, in dealings with others and oneself. I believe that lies are unnecessary, and that the truth is neither good nor bad. I believe that it is important to always have an open mind. It is important to be curious about things and people and take all aspects of them into account. The funny thing is that you usually learn something about yourself in the process. I also believe that there is something good in everyone, so no one should be treated as a bad person. If you don't like someone, don't be around them. And lastly, my most odd belief and value is that God is my best friend. And I treat him as such. I say ""hey how ya doin'?"" and ""whassup."" I ask how his day went. I find that much nicer than constantly asking him for this and that without even so much as a how do you do.","Beginning a week ago, I did my usual routine of work/home stuff. On Friday, I got paid and got my Christmas bonus which was cool. That evening my boyfriend came over and we hung out and got drunk and I made dinner (lemon butter shrimp and broccoli.) The next morning we went to a diner for breakfast and then hung out for the rest of the day and watched movies and made out. We accidentally missed choir practice but made it to church the next day. I went and did some work that afternoon and then we hung out that evening. Monday started the whole work/home routine again. I was reminded that Christmas is almost here so I ordered a present from Amazon for my boyfriend which was delivered Thursday. Its a tracker for his keys and his wallet. He is always losing things! On Wednesday we drank a little too much and went to choir practice. I think some people got pissed off but I don't really care. We had fun. Then yesterday, I stayed home and made myself chicken-fried hamburger patties. It's like my comfort food. I ate it with fresh spinach and then went to bed early.",5.0,3.5,4.0,3.8333333333333335,4.0,1.1666666666666667,3.1666666666666665,3.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,2.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,22,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2,42,1,English,1,5,R_1n8cJHxDjLFUz2E,-0.08104334,0.031171065,0.0756644,-0.0121974535,-0.008734621,0.11335477,-0.029731112,0.023317758,0.038546637,0.089602366,-0.119822174,-0.051203843,0.12048232,0.14255637,0.08619249,0.09369115,0.1102976,-0.024603007,-0.08857957,0.026283856,0.05026073,-0.0032372759,-0.008287612,0.05643196,0.08037285,0.083333105,0.077347964,0.0101892855,-0.012878829,-0.10593182,0.0402133,0.12491477,0.08764227,0.002531616,-0.020587774,-0.112396404,-0.029533109,-0.0323326,-0.13193922,-0.06889891,-0.10620196,0.18365984,0.022728652,-0.034939118,0.02311888,-0.16429044,-0.028738013,-0.08390138,-0.015285954,0.06493387,-0.04826298,-0.055755723,0.19697727,-0.01516174,0.08209288,0.14801642,0.122967824,0.12306132,0.20315641,0.051863123,-0.033274796,0.025237784,-0.044087216,-0.03328239,-0.084843695,-0.05347601,0.051544026,0.0036342945,-0.046572804,-0.05169012,0.014575705,-0.03875111,0.079969026,0.047576427,0.008957667,0.044678234,-0.0005975291,-0.011138695,-0.0529005,0.01277877,-0.14062639,-0.07012378,-0.079590484,-0.087851435,-0.029704727,-0.06666149,-0.00992848,0.14959082,0.018902814,-0.010345625,-0.06409518,-0.06691823,-0.0054166876,-0.00854343,-0.041272238,-0.02142914,-0.0585311,-0.12579986
"In general, I try to live my best life. I want to raise my daughters as good humans, so I'm strict but I also try to be fun. I discipline when they don't listen, or when they do something that I don't think is correct. I try to treat everyone in my life or that I even come across with respect, as I'd want them to treat me. I also have a rule where I don't put up with anything I shouldn't, as I've experienced a lot of negativity in my life and promised I would never put up with it again. I make mistakes, but I do try to learn from them as much as possible to avoid making them a second time. It's important for me to set a good example for all of my family, and help however I can. My partner is not good with any technology, so I make it my priority to try to help him figure out bills and other types of stuff to the best of my ability. I believe our children are a big reflection of how their raised, which is why it's important for me to make sure I'm doing as right as I possibly can.","Last weekend, I started the day off as I usually do. I get up, do some work, wake up all 3 of my girls, and get my oldest ready for school for the day. I work a little more, and then get my 2 little ones ready for the day. I get them dressed, brush their teeth, and do their hair. I work a little more, have snack time, then it's my turn to take a shower. I let them play while I clean myself fast. Then I focus on chores. After chores it's lunch time, then nap time for my kids. I put them down for a nap, clean more, and relax for a few minutes. I wake them up, cook dinner, and then bath time. We relax, watch shows/nursery rhymes, and then it's bed time. I spend some time with my partner, and pass out. Over the weekend, we don't have the little ones, so I like to play video games and drink seltzers. This week was my daughter's birthday, so we broke from our usual routine. I kept her home from school, and my mother came to pick us up. We went to get a few birthday freebies I had found, and then drove to a different town to have pizza together. I also made her a special breakfast, as well as a lava cake in my crockpot.",3.1666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,5.0,2.0,2.833333333333333,1.5,4.666666666666667,3.8333333333333335,5.5,4.5,4.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,2.5,4.0,5.5,5.0,6,3.6666666666666665,5.0,4.166666666666667,1,34,6,English,1,5,R_1eRawWSYsccy4By,-0.025273912,-0.012624372,0.15498522,0.08649004,0.022660118,0.10362318,-0.0028002672,-0.004521748,0.08111759,0.09286298,-0.06297754,0.023999019,0.011335868,0.15032898,-0.0121466555,0.004003225,-0.04347893,0.043215144,-0.083072394,0.024642322,-0.031112444,0.03866576,0.0023789555,0.027187884,-0.006528426,0.12287349,0.035615977,0.11036802,-0.012632336,-0.027292361,0.11699138,0.19672489,0.073423415,0.13134071,0.034433167,-0.11586837,-0.05466081,-0.04602376,-0.08898988,-0.13046871,-0.09819517,0.202472,0.091688946,-0.010266863,0.009054672,-0.049904667,-0.05657827,0.018935036,0.023770891,0.043829385,-0.011617258,-0.027050968,0.12032681,0.1382994,0.071491234,0.12129828,0.055971693,0.062211618,0.24541923,0.1344921,0.07560848,0.11508925,-0.0891565,-0.061899826,-0.025775418,-0.044292588,0.03759738,-0.0023915432,0.015962398,-0.02790052,0.079177156,-0.03317143,0.044034354,-0.032375652,0.009228565,0.01184283,-0.03087888,-0.042193484,0.0062084068,0.13110638,0.04873311,-0.096022114,-0.015775638,0.031031322,0.003659862,-0.049315706,-0.043658484,0.09269347,0.11599691,0.051287178,0.005721435,-0.081984244,-0.06763338,-0.023049163,-0.08592171,-0.06774755,-0.056486715,0.0073422138
"My value system was taught to me by my parents. They began me on the road to becoming a good human being. While they were the ones responsible for giving me the basic value system I use today, I have also learned through time and experience what it means to be a good person. My values are based on being a good person. By this I mean that I treat others as I would like to be treated and while that seems a bit simple, it is actually complex. My values go far and beyond that simple phrase. I try to be the person that has integrity and I want to be the person that everyone sees as honest.","The past seven days have been fairly routine with a couple odd ball incidents thrown in for the excitement of it all. I began my week by going to work and doing all of the normal things people do at work. I came home to find that one of our cats was about to die so that night, I stayed up with my cat. He died early the next morning and I buried him in the family pet cemetery. The next day was a terrible day. We had a huge wind storm and it knocked down fences, trees, etc. The power of course went out so I had to go get gas so I could use the generator. Once that was done, everything went back to routine as usual.",4.166666666666667,1.0,4.833333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.1666666666666665,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.5,3.5,1.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,9,3.6666666666666665,7.0,3.5,2,49,1,English,1,5,R_82hweZlCuItFvqx,-0.0010678433,0.07558367,0.07554425,0.058260556,0.08009732,0.14563742,0.054899585,0.1802794,0.1400499,0.06523095,-0.011631173,0.06905289,0.19851607,0.21886915,0.15413663,0.12569581,0.1302354,0.12983099,-0.010444949,0.025829505,0.081424415,-0.08252989,-0.019854095,0.026754502,0.014636116,-0.0046809204,0.08949498,0.05723842,-0.048851468,0.04769467,0.12834293,0.17695498,0.11064033,0.13494854,0.030244488,-0.06389464,0.05167903,-0.0034969142,-0.06873121,-0.052673843,-0.05361039,0.2096231,0.031021127,-0.012398798,-0.0076244585,-0.04765584,0.060414393,0.064834096,-0.012249097,0.06740089,0.06136056,0.123603635,0.23524126,0.232091,0.11936611,0.17253816,-0.027145278,0.056865945,0.18651986,0.047464345,0.0497109,0.016649686,0.044625558,0.0036686556,0.06782824,0.18171129,0.20058537,0.097219095,-0.03406487,-0.04591728,0.042714253,-0.066602126,0.044051632,0.020256922,-0.009984907,-0.045087732,-0.016831914,0.008934595,-0.01853472,0.12788227,-0.16529171,-0.0018374994,-0.009574763,-0.061069217,-0.011561815,-0.020253964,-0.04679226,0.19261095,-0.08657991,0.16573441,-0.099911824,-0.03212219,-0.019935412,-0.07442674,0.016780589,0.065917976,0.0011501648,-0.055483505

Being authentic and real with myself and in my interactions is of high value for me.  I don't go about my day thinking about achieving this.  I've always felt this way.  I can remember being a kid and not feeling comfortable around people who were not acting in a natural way or seemed fake.,"Well, there have been some good meals this week with lots of fresh organic veggies I have been roasting.  I bought French butter, so that makes it even better.  I haven't been working much. Last week I took a short trip and stayed with friends. I  got to spend some time with someone who is very important to me.  My dog was at the kennel for the weekend.  He had fun playing with the other dogs.  Normally, he is with me 24/7.  I participated in some interesting work related seminars online this week. Also, I received a prize I had won for attending the online seminar.  The gift basket included cookies, gourmet hot cocoa mix and a golden spoon for stirring.",4.166666666666667,2.6666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,1.8333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,3.333333333333333,4.5,5.5,2.5,4.333333333333333,2.5,4.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,9,3.333333333333333,1.0,3.0,1,54,7,English,16,5,R_dgl3Xj3zeMpedFL,0.076101616,0.045323603,0.11816843,0.017618611,0.07829875,0.18613383,0.05568567,0.14982432,0.19940767,0.23165283,0.05329661,0.092422515,0.19969656,0.1943394,0.18519837,0.11807735,0.12905353,0.0058361394,0.0017070044,0.026194774,0.108502604,0.06710663,-0.028990602,0.06834975,0.036997333,-0.018785868,0.14806215,0.045018487,0.006453639,-0.04135203,0.088611946,0.15004018,0.11143818,0.15829684,0.027357088,-0.024295392,-0.0031495746,-0.016110027,-0.08512235,-0.057054274,-0.05492983,0.26912382,-0.0063310526,0.07734268,0.16857529,-0.114433005,0.048731815,-0.012912682,0.185524,0.19307446,0.017141933,0.030712262,0.27609545,0.120256655,0.11486877,0.13786666,0.15070045,0.16898707,0.24191068,0.16604382,0.1706765,0.081841074,0.06572755,0.06050857,-0.051867396,0.07346605,0.04703705,0.061209507,-0.00012420118,-0.07452539,0.036051594,-0.035003856,0.15706283,0.06847717,0.013663035,0.097105,0.03416478,0.15957767,-0.018315542,0.11915277,-0.1315191,-0.040777296,-0.01363644,-0.036602568,0.033207454,-0.059513856,-0.03464298,0.11629942,-0.03561738,0.03692025,-0.07010393,-0.013907453,-0.07719676,0.03732968,-0.031465612,0.090085626,-0.020317247,-0.0064315014
"I’m always lost. I’m glad I met my husband. He not only supports me on everything I do but guides me to the right path. I would tell him everything or whatever that bothers and he’ll try to talk me through and help me. So whenever I make a decision, I’ll talk to him about it.","On Saturday I was just running errands since the weather forecast said the storm starts Sunday. Like buying groceries, and cleaning up the house. On Sunday, it was stormy so I basically stayed home all day and was being a couch potato. It’s always nice to just stay in bed all day watching tv on a stormy day with a nice cup of coffee. From Monday until today, Friday, I’m basically at work then after work I went home to walk my dogs.

"I believe one should live a life with as little negative impact on others and their environment as possible. I believe if possible, you should live a righteous and helpful life, willing to assist those around you. If everyone acted in a non-selfish and non-self-centered way, the world would be a more positive, effective place.","Everyday, I wake up, and the first thing I do is walk my dog, and make sure he has enough food and water. Then I dress for work, and go to work for 8-9 hours starting at 9AM. When I arrive back home from work, I walk my dog, and check his food and water bowls again. Then I typically do meal prep for 2-3 days, which takes 1-2 hours. I typically eat dinner after that. For leisure, I'll watch a TV show or movie on one of the streaming services I am subscribed to. Occasionally, I'll have a friend come over during the weeknights and we'll watch a movie.",2.333333333333333,3.5,2.833333333333333,1.8333333333333333,2.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.666666666666667,1.0,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,4.0,7,3.0,4.0,3.1666666666666665,2,35,5,English,3,3,R_3XexwUGzMVaB6Lv,0.08527444,0.10614125,0.22400269,0.14232168,0.0345727,0.14799368,0.08053362,0.0682411,0.1105032,0.17298764,0.014122795,0.11781869,0.34622407,0.3903565,0.1424275,0.105350725,0.036907565,0.020918343,-0.048734825,-0.0012984746,0.11673547,0.015545124,0.037463054,0.13491227,0.06841724,0.029104173,0.12039138,0.03196737,0.020867828,0.05350641,0.2130366,0.13549048,0.072790295,0.24134201,0.16718595,0.045746997,0.07903837,0.11174174,0.011407256,-0.019980526,0.072325006,0.29721332,0.19190559,0.22965425,0.10190305,0.017333379,0.06049724,0.050829813,0.14343672,0.18796012,0.08250333,0.06233553,0.18120661,0.33262584,0.16630834,0.2167465,0.07728968,0.13796276,0.39649582,0.19731711,0.24426728,0.17786215,0.0040940996,0.0025208555,-0.0060132453,-0.0047945566,0.020068299,0.064989716,0.018144343,-0.010049632,0.07976682,0.062436257,0.03197529,-0.009081704,0.02155289,0.02763882,0.028615467,0.04831181,0.04328461,0.10772684,-0.06610063,-0.07458618,-0.006395817,-0.026838649,-0.048639253,-0.08709174,0.017458394,0.1549965,0.04475846,0.04060462,-0.033447534,-0.0049248748,0.004677372,0.036708977,-0.024380252,0.04838299,-0.048582435,0.08005075
"I have a lot of important values in life.
1. Love--I try to love everyone that is around me.  My family comes first no matter what and I love each and everyone of them.  I love with my whole heart and I wear my heart on my sleeve.
2. Respect--respect comes with respect given.  I try to treat each and every person the same and the way that I would expect to be treated.
3. Opinions--as you go through life you will interact with people who have different opinions that you and that is ok.
4. Dreams-- I dream big and I plan to achieve every dream that I can.
5. Goals--my husband and I have set big goals for our lives and we are slowly knocking them out one by one.","One week ago I was preparing for my total hysterectomy.  Sunday I had to go get COVID testing and typed and crossed as well as a pregnancy test.  This all came back negative.  Tuesday I took my 12 year old dog to the vets. They did vaccine titers, blood work, heartworm, Lyme test and a fecal sample.  Wednesday I had surgery.  I am currently at home recovering for the next 2 weeks.  I am sore and exhausted but overall feeling good.  I got a call today that my dogs bloodwork was all normal.  What a relief.

My basic values are to treat people with kindness. I try to think about others but I do also consider myself because many people will not think about you first. As long as I am doing something that causes no harm to others I feel I can live my life as I want. I have never had a structured upbrining. It was always chaos. Later in my life where I am now I am a bit lost and after losing my Mom this past year I feel like I am on hold. There are issues with the house I live in and my sisters interest in it. I am not making plans to go anyplace until this pans out and because of Covid it enables me to stay inside and hide. I am not living my life but it is safe for me at this time to stay alone and away from other people.,In the past week I have not done anything out of the normal. I am not working this week and I have not left the house. What I do when I wake up is watch some tv in bed. I then get up tell Alexa to turn my office light on and come to my office area and pull up my computer. On some days before I do this I will use my tablet to read or play a game. I also may look at my phone to see emails or calls missed. Because I am usually working at home I do not have a set sleep schedule. One I log into my computer I will come to MTURK and also bring up my emails. I will usually bring up Youtube on my other monitor and watch my favorite channels. I go to the bathroom. I get something to drink usually a diet pepsi because I do what I want. I also if needed do online ordering via instacart to get groceries delivered. I check on my orders if they are being delivered from amazon.com. I then a few hours later in the day make something to eat in my PowerXL 12 in 1 air fryer combo. I love that machine. Once I start Mtuk I usually depending on the task I pause youtube and do a survery or two. When I feel tired I sleep when I feel hungry I eat.

"The absolute most important value in life is honesty. I believe in dealing with people straight, and that if they ask me my true opinion, i won't lie, or obfuscate, to soften it. I do not volunteer mean things, I only give my opinion when asked. I believe this has earned me the respect of those people whom I respect. I believe it has also cost me friendships with those who are less than honorable in their words and deeds.

I would say that my next most important value is my compassion. I do not want to ever lose my compassion for others, as I feel this greatly informs my actions. It is better to be taken advantage of for this trait, than to not offer it. I feel too many people are closed off to the plight of others, and the world could be a much better place if we all just showed each other some more compassion. I feel exhibiting my honesty and compassion are who I truly want to be, and I do my best to demonstrate these in my everyday dealings and actions.","This last week for me was quite a busy week, as I had to get surgery for one of my dogs. So, starting last Friday, we had an initial appointment and health screen at the vet, which was about an hour and a half long visit. That day also saw some interest in some items I had been trying to sell on Facebook marketplace, some fencing, and an old gate. I was lucky to sell both items, so taking Friday off was a win for me. I was able to get some Mturking in then, too. Saturday and Sunday were uneventful, but I did get to work out on Sunday ,and again on Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday I was able to prepare and cook full dinners for supper, and got to get some work in also. I completed all my cleaning chores for the week, such as dusting, vacuuming, sweeping and mopping the floors. Thursday I had to keep a very close eye on my puppy, as if she gets too excited she could hurt herself.",5.0,4.666666666666667,3.5,1.5,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,4.166666666666667,2.833333333333333,4.5,3.5,5.666666666666668,2.5,2.5,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.5,5.0,5,3.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,2,47,6,English,1,3,R_6kQG1ZnnwRSWHT3,-0.047413297,-0.025512887,0.14365347,0.05728852,0.047765635,0.16133326,0.027894285,0.03423959,0.11111364,0.092815764,-0.07010864,0.074063115,0.14593536,0.19853492,0.124558195,0.08841478,0.13186961,0.007595904,-0.02606528,-0.042208932,0.049083658,0.049096756,0.015392665,-0.05300984,-0.006853517,0.011525765,0.15782909,0.019871555,-0.0574657,-0.01579253,0.100508735,0.13267204,0.110897884,0.11102622,0.09058641,-0.089042276,0.024898205,0.021728585,-0.08155482,-0.031312622,-0.09017686,0.17819521,0.093447044,0.044450574,0.06235909,-0.094856955,-0.052683808,-0.015072336,0.06330056,0.1836573,0.0029469877,0.037447147,0.116698176,0.104812935,0.10855291,0.2202667,0.05679798,0.07990278,0.2405495,0.10608247,0.11638838,0.077845275,0.061050333,0.04368096,-0.0031479485,0.0488142,0.08553739,0.098189965,0.013847249,0.009930581,0.03224264,-0.026580049,0.064690955,0.030014776,0.10583969,-0.035670977,0.07988968,-0.00033231825,0.03214535,0.12048221,-0.1657798,-0.090717115,-0.06342864,-0.100794345,-0.112140946,-0.057051215,-0.09129974,0.08225557,0.018204529,0.026419895,-0.047124103,-0.020227112,-0.009528533,-0.016467763,-0.06073717,-0.0019107871,-0.022542994,-0.109801255
"For the past thirty years that I have been on this earth, I've learned about some values that I find very important to me. The first one is honesty, I feel that being honest so important. Trust is very valuable and not something that can be gained back if at all. Next is respect, I treat others how I would like to be treated. It doesn't always mean that I get treated with respect but, I think it has done more good than bad. I admire people that always try to be the bigger person. That's what I try to do in situations where there's a conflict or my patience is being tested. I also value self-discipline and strive for that in my life. It's very easy to get addicted to certain things like food or activities. Practicing self-discipline strengthens the mind. I believe that if you don't have any self-discipline at all, it's a huge weakness that should be worked on. Lastly, I value hard work and always believed in giving 110 percent in anything that I do. It's not always appreciated or noticed but it makes me feel good. I'm not perfect by a long shot but I'm trying. I'm always trying to make better choices and improving on any weaknesses that I might have.","This past week I've been studying for a part-time job that I was interested in. It was for the position of ""map quality analyst"". We had to read a lengthy book about all kinds of guidelines and rules that should be followed when doing the job.

"My main guide in life is my religion and so is G-d. I follow the laws and guidelines that were passed down for thousands of years. Also, I am conscious of how my behaviour and attitude affects those around me and I strive to leave a good imprint and to bring a smile to people.
Elderly people are an influence on me and I learn from their experiences of life the best I can.
I do not let failure bring me down but rather use it to grow from it.","I have participated in prayer services 21 times in the past week. I have also participated in study groups this week. 
For work I checked on the stock market and bought and sold a few stocks. I also look for work to do at home to supplement my income.
I started and finished the first chapter for a web novel I started this week.
For leisure I read several novels online and I go to a martial arts class on Wednesday evening.

"My family is my first and foremost concern on the daily basis.  I do what I can for all of them.  My pets are next and I care for them with the best of my ability.  As for guiding principles, I am spiritual but belong to no organized religion.  I try to be a good person, I believe in God, I often think what my views of Heaven are and the type or person I want to be.  However, my depression, anxiety, and PTSD does affect a lot of my days and makes everything that much harder.  I also have a couple of very close friends who live in different states. I spend time talking them via the phone, text messages, messenger, or in online video games.","Seven days ago, I had a normal day where I got up, fed the pets, worked on some Christmas projects I'm making as gifts, took my medications, ate breakfast and dinner, while skipping lunch. I worked on the computer via MTurk off an on as I had a chance and ended the evening with a variety of things such as watching videos (news), videos (music), and playing a video game.  All of my days this week have been similar except Sunday was my youngest son's 24th birthday and we had a small get together and family dinner for him.  Monday, I had an appointment for a blood draw at 8AM and a physical therapy appointment at 3PM.  Tuesday, I had an orthopedic doctor appointment for my knee with severe arthritis, got an update on it and a cortisone injection.  That made me jittery for 2 days so I had extra energy to do those Christmas projects. Did a little bit of shopping yesterday to get a few more things I needed for finishing them. Then, at night, I put my pets to bed, take my evening medications, take a shower, then go to bed.  I know I did laundry and dishes at least one of those days but I do not remember which.",3.8333333333333335,2.1666666666666665,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,5.0,3.5,5.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.5,18,3.1666666666666665,4.5,4.166666666666667,1,49,7,English,1,4,R_2EiQhY6vCAfoaBv,-0.027736714,-0.06465043,0.07903953,0.022378083,-0.012567947,0.11257974,-0.05005669,0.04432567,0.06600345,0.017761597,-0.122672796,-0.03857027,0.0443356,0.13549177,0.073171265,0.055750247,0.0047979094,0.03231118,-0.06374564,-0.024386501,0.015831422,0.051492147,-0.043416142,-0.050052244,-0.03371197,0.03822394,0.03485662,0.038979888,-0.07501131,-0.06529145,0.07078724,0.15058208,0.13214792,0.022870736,0.09052678,-0.16901374,-0.07461029,-0.06114091,-0.16942081,-0.10240214,-0.18477124,0.18574178,0.007949015,-0.045586165,-0.05596701,-0.110920876,-0.035039775,-0.06568345,0.003506083,-0.002482146,-0.12931535,-0.061415397,0.072656795,0.06753097,-0.018986795,0.10133213,0.0014746096,0.039842147,0.13364196,0.051045194,0.017448632,-0.011239953,0.01592395,0.016067177,0.033044122,0.056395378,0.040233962,0.031532403,-0.023395577,-0.037703797,0.03367593,-0.07864036,0.027059954,0.001947186,0.0018893573,0.0076778606,-0.02656712,-0.070990525,-0.05354239,0.016159154,-0.07937279,-0.1356656,-0.10365835,-0.06475211,-0.072714224,-0.08366537,-0.115361616,0.027187223,0.025899787,0.018095681,-0.06832526,-0.10232931,-0.024569474,-0.09443124,-0.14184013,0.0006854534,0.017616995,-0.1762906
The most important values the govern my life are honest and integrity. I  treat others the way I want to be treated. I think everyone generally knows what is right and wrong. Values are like muscles that must be exercised on a regular basis or else they lose their ability. A person who knows what is right may not have the strength of values to exercise them because their values have become feeble from lack of use.,I usually live a simple life. I eat breakfast and then look at the morning news. I do a few chores and then eat lunch. I then usually relax in the afternoon by reading a book and then taking a nap. I then have a snack and check the news again. I then do a few more chores around the house. I eat supper and then relax by listening to music. This is my normal routine everyday.,2.1666666666666665,1.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.833333333333333,2.1666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,2.1666666666666665,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,5,3.0,4.5,3.6666666666666665,2,51,6,english,1,5,R_2uWX3j6Vk9CJINf,0.081046484,0.2693478,0.16587079,0.20284426,0.08586533,0.1702853,0.15338328,0.052498724,0.15370223,0.119219005,0.045411028,0.18119735,0.2704363,0.44841397,0.16469717,0.20105095,0.13817078,-0.013650451,-0.039583117,0.00859668,0.078898266,0.016308889,-0.018818375,0.12291712,0.13916746,0.15128443,0.09943016,0.08378893,0.003256876,0.17678487,0.23631503,0.110968575,0.0932004,0.2505696,0.20173678,0.014558717,0.113300465,0.05655434,0.08667072,-0.11471345,0.10685231,0.2685867,0.21886799,0.21639074,0.073906966,0.12937851,0.13592646,0.15535228,0.09998504,0.21444905,0.16918597,0.12881233,0.1496467,0.35695958,0.14426006,0.3570361,0.14874625,0.20394117,0.32885814,0.23265612,0.17535803,0.19683126,0.03342332,0.058901057,0.073390335,0.058642197,0.122447334,0.01722382,0.010664758,0.066010036,0.18271124,0.07406701,0.08705098,-0.023962816,0.048155393,0.021943957,-0.022056613,0.011453643,0.14943963,0.16019547,-0.031507917,-0.059916202,0.017045014,-0.016962338,-0.029136294,-0.050076008,0.102522075,0.259248,0.06721079,0.10371385,-0.01771909,0.048363417,0.03874898,0.037645385,-0.07713777,-0.03908422,0.03432629,0.0374844
"The most basic value I have is to treat others the way I want to be treated. Bullying and intimidation are tactics of the insecure to make themselves feel better for a time. It is an unacceptable coping mechanism to me. 
Helping others in need is also important. I tend to root for the underdog in many situations and always want to help people who want to succeed.",In the past week I planned a vacation with my partner and made travel arrangements to visit family in the new year. I ordered the last of the Christmas presents and wrapped them when they arrived and put them under the tree. I have also started organizing and cleaning up our living spaces since we will have visitors at the end of the year. I have spent every day working online when I can since household chores take up a lot of time.

I personally like to live by honesty. I believe honesty is a very important virtue to have. This creates loyalty and friendship and sustains relationships between people. This value i would say describes me very well and forms who i am. I always try to tell the truth to anyone i meet because i know they deserve it .,This week i started slow as i was bored . I went to work as usual and did my job as usual then went home and stayed with my family. The next day my wife and I had an argument and went to work while i was mad. The next day was as usual but we had reconciled. The next day my son was sick and had to take the day off to take him to the hospital. The next day i went out drinking with my buddies but did not stay for long.

"I try to live life by a simple guideline:  Treat other people how you want to, and expect to, be treated.  This involves being honest with everyone, helping out whenever possible, showing empathy and compassion, and spreading love and happiness.  These different aspects all relate to how you treat others and expect to be treated.  It's not necessarily a religious thing (""Do unto others..."") but more of a personal thing.  I don't need religion to tell me what I feel everyone should do out of common sense.  A little respect given, goes a long way to receiving.","In the last seven days, I've done the usual stuff that I do pretty much every other week.  I've brought my son to school with my wife, and picked him up with her as well.  I've worked all day every day until about 5pm, at which time I usually eat some dinner and try to unwind.  After that I'll maybe play with my son, or play video games if he's playing with his friends.  After a little while of that, I'll usually go to bed but read my phone before actually going to sleep.  Sometimes during the day I'll break for lunch, but usually I just keep working through to get more time in.  On some days, I'll also do a workout depending on which day it is and how I'm feeling.  I try to alternate body parts and then take a day of rest between, but sometimes I need more rest than usual.  Today, I've been browsing Best Buy and doing some window shopping, but realizing I don't really have enough money to do that.",4.0,2.1666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,2.0,2.0,4.166666666666667,2.333333333333333,5.5,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,5.0,2.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,8,3.5,3.5,3.8333333333333335,2,44,6,English,1,3,R_20TNbEDOLDjHRj0,-0.079285935,0.035144165,0.14814043,0.09985468,0.003246087,0.17021543,-0.059474595,-0.061962582,0.06602357,0.06918922,-0.059406172,0.036843915,0.12938552,0.26835996,0.032448843,0.050607055,0.07485971,-0.045984082,-0.06900569,-0.046173662,-0.03195558,0.038733117,-0.022728948,0.008965611,-0.023887457,0.020673689,0.048232116,0.029673357,-0.010793966,0.031041525,0.15037368,0.16352957,0.14866346,0.11078244,0.15962917,-0.11736807,-0.055373617,-0.088043705,-0.08749832,-0.1331636,-0.085075736,0.22916347,0.07434846,0.11127522,-0.020487653,-0.10510281,-0.058875114,-0.024581604,0.027895141,0.10130114,-0.0025684657,0.0071092113,0.042592056,0.2051895,0.036424056,0.14772359,-0.01953373,0.057596534,0.25796467,0.10266715,0.089841,0.07148543,-0.047008537,-0.05463723,-0.03116983,-0.066577196,0.06578856,0.029403428,-0.0013311002,-0.016467648,0.10150865,0.0605879,0.06503363,0.0004808721,0.10879858,-0.008101426,0.004963983,-0.12228681,0.010892315,0.015240129,-0.06150944,-0.14939475,-0.13640112,-0.057111733,-0.06794191,-0.04132993,-0.0830297,0.05122781,0.02823753,-0.040583562,-0.06957919,-0.046233,-0.05951549,-0.057371378,-0.15223414,-0.06777847,-0.030164484,-0.092851505
"The most important values to me are those my parents taught to me, not just as a child, but throughout their lifetimes and my own. Of course the general golden rule one go without saying:  Be kind, be polite, respect others as well as yourself, do right by others, stand up and speak for or defend those who can't do so for themselves. One of the unique things that my parents share with my brother and I when we were young was to do four things each and every day to live a good life. 1) Do something kind for a total stranger. It could be something as simple as smiling and saying hello, or leaving a coin in a candy machine for the next child to find. 2) Do something kind for someone you love. Sometimes it would be do the dishes, laundry or lawnmowing even when it was not expected of you to help out a family member. Other times it could be offering a treat or favorite toy to a best friend, or spending time with elderly grandparents when you'd rather being playing with friends. 3) Do something kind for the world or our community. It could be picking up trash thrown beside a public trash can, or volunteering to help a local group or animal shelter. And last, 4) Do something kind for yourself. It could be use your allowance to buy your favorite candy, spend extra time doing your favorite activity, or just challenge any negative thoughts you've had. The key to the last one, my parents stressed, was that it was not enough to just ""do"" for others, you must also do for yourself. Those simple four things are something I still do 60 years later every single day, and I think most of my core values come from the mainstay of those four actions every day.","Starting a week ago I did my routine daily tasks which include feeding and exercising my pets, working out for 15-20 minutes, having a light breakfast, taking a shower and starting my day. Last week I went to the food store, came home and put my items away. I worked on graphic designs for a few hours, then had dinner with my boyfriend, watched the end of a movie after he left and then went to bed. The next two days I did my daily morning routine, then did some household chores like laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom. I also finished up some Christmas shopping, made a few phone calls, and had take-out dinner with a girl friend. The next thee days I did my normal routine, and then spent several hours on a new research project I contracted to do. One evening I watched a movie when I finished work for the day. The other nights I either watched news or listened to music.",5.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.166666666666667,3.333333333333333,2.333333333333333,4.0,3.8333333333333335,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,3.5,4.0,5.5,5.5,4.0,6.0,20,3.5,2.0,4.0,1,63,1,English,1,3,R_vCCHEFuQfz9m5cR,-0.04261693,-0.0022362731,0.10031779,0.15714759,0.0002723001,0.14331077,-0.070688404,-0.051859323,0.07970646,-0.00561296,-0.09850216,0.032909535,0.08313279,0.19586834,0.08062119,0.09573872,0.050429225,-0.016512016,-0.004157372,0.0073496066,0.01720894,-0.044016205,-0.005609965,0.028618453,-0.004331448,0.024518104,0.10966761,-0.021124335,-0.03573472,-0.00033294223,0.07592964,0.20130765,0.10457732,0.104777634,0.102234945,-0.14595093,-0.096550085,-0.077444956,-0.13413279,-0.12417766,-0.1344887,0.23825206,0.096139066,0.024886902,-0.017847892,-0.16197836,-0.035329975,-0.05564795,0.04819885,0.1081073,-0.05312685,-0.048683956,0.078226164,0.17806469,0.042877246,0.17354393,-0.0024222564,0.12311626,0.19553278,0.1448622,0.049660683,0.08105246,-0.0841104,-0.08918911,-0.09527299,-0.040369354,-0.06253105,0.031732883,-0.034506544,-0.044506766,0.024715643,-0.06977944,-0.010299522,-0.036301203,0.027691146,-0.03998439,-0.037800424,-0.08707923,-0.030547826,0.101590194,-0.12945977,-0.15363944,-0.12957168,-0.11917915,-0.0847205,-0.109689094,-0.090308174,0.05195204,-0.04052244,-0.06582618,-0.14233491,-0.05130312,-0.048632924,-0.03618215,-0.12468705,0.07988168,-0.03926578,-0.088482
"My most important values are all rooted in my Catholic faith. I believe in living by the 7 virtues, as well as doing unto others as you want done to you. My faith shapes my guiding principles in life. I believe in working hard, as well as the fact if you work hard enough you will be very successful in life. I believe in personal responsibility and independence need to come first. It's shaped me into a very religious, conservative person. I believe that we live by two sets of laws, the law of the land and the law of the Lord. I do my best to not be hypocritical about my values, and to never back down from my faith. I think my core principles have shaped me into a determined, persevering, strong, and enduring person. I've experienced incredible hardship and even devastation in my life and I've never backed down or given up.","I think I've always had a pretty set routine as my base activity, and then I do whatever is needed on top of that. Last Friday feels like a very long time ago, because it's been a very hectic work week. I always get up, get dressed, make the bed, take meds/vitamins and check my email first thing. I got up and went to work, came home, then went for a long run outside. I cooked on Saturday a ham, homemade bread, and sweet potatoes, plus made cheese. I also went to church Saturday evening, as well as spent 2 hrs exercising. Sunday I went for a walk through the community, did some crafting/painting, and cleared out some old items I didn't need any more. Monday is back to the workweek, and I exercised for 2 hrs both indoors and outdoors. I spent some time reading a library book, and ran errands to the library. Tuesday I was ill most of the morning, and then went for a run, cleaned my apartment bathroom and counters, as well as paid bills. Wednesday I spent most of the day working, with breaks to clean my apartment further, as well as do two workouts. Thursday I was up early to get groceries from the store, and spoke with my apartment manager to finish renewing my lease paperwork. I had to gather some documents for her. I reorganized my pantry, read a book, did a long workout indoors, and did budgeting tasks. Because I couldn't sleep last night, I spent some time playing the Sims 4 on my PC. I then got up early this morning, did my usual routine, and got on the computer to go to work, where I've been working since.",3.0,1.3333333333333333,5.0,4.0,4.666666666666667,4.5,4.166666666666667,3.8333333333333335,4.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0,2.5,6.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,26,3.6666666666666665,7.0,2.833333333333333,1,31,1,English,12,5,R_21HBNWbr5SRsDm0,-0.047443703,0.059030756,0.0664286,0.08119973,0.024480801,0.13557029,-0.02370483,0.010973506,0.06991333,0.08150311,-0.0064863525,0.057116456,0.19012414,0.27760535,0.13278642,0.121741176,0.08604503,-0.04949475,-0.06639704,-0.014015418,0.023101168,0.018826762,-0.075443156,0.007098184,0.051488355,0.017820574,0.053743117,0.006795829,-0.023031795,0.0009200014,0.06106548,0.15672898,0.08991801,0.093147,0.10533758,-0.06516761,-0.021178614,-0.06301869,-0.13728479,-0.1523601,-0.06205589,0.21359006,0.037762206,-0.008358404,-0.02193898,-0.11558911,-0.024297964,-0.03663674,0.04686063,0.07950346,-0.009611599,-0.010115629,0.08092798,0.19108963,0.054248545,0.18924259,0.0021067075,0.11995661,0.19997498,0.07126383,0.076914996,0.008556896,-0.0050826706,-0.046761777,-0.069588125,0.0024085324,-0.0018966366,-0.027267339,-0.043358058,-0.016582234,0.036086082,-0.040483378,0.042106904,-0.08423293,0.019687438,-0.03072229,0.041648306,-0.059635077,0.0049372995,0.09247833,-0.19451813,-0.17537908,-0.08338167,-0.07734761,-0.09616007,-0.012166567,-0.046298083,0.15440251,-0.024843177,-0.0003314754,-0.14686021,-0.048806865,-0.03379325,-0.07190941,-0.12786426,-0.050124228,-0.024419628,-0.13712448
"I would say the most central value is to be nice to other people. Even when that might be a hard thing to do. It seems hatred is winning the battle and people must learn to be nice to each other or we will not survive. I also strive for truth and that can be found in studying science and following the dictates that its conclusions would demand. Yes, that is what is most central to me. Being nice to each other, respecting each other, and seeking the truth.","For all of the last seven days, save for one in which we got take-out, I cooked all the dinners for myself and my wife. Spaghetti and meatballs I think was the highlight, but I believe my wife would say it is the fish.
It was about a week ago that I made a day of putting new strings on my two favorite guitars (the alverez-yairi acoustic, and my 'strat') That was time consuming but very satisfying, as new strings tend to be. Went to a hockey game with two grandkids the next night. It was the Teddy Bear Toss and everyone had a great time.",4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,2.333333333333333,1.5,3.5,3.1666666666666665,5.0,2.0,5.333333333333333,2.0,4.5,4.5,2.5,3.0,4.5,4.5,5,3.0,1.5,3.0,2,67,6,english,1,3,R_22VstQJs33tasCm,0.06193149,0.11067932,0.14812112,0.1280695,0.06975162,0.17796326,0.063969165,0.14790803,0.10770905,0.27293748,0.054778107,0.007221436,0.13668057,0.19445254,0.1691427,0.063793086,0.046564784,0.09082076,-0.031137243,0.018898077,0.09993504,0.03790364,0.028010355,0.15516658,0.15050519,0.033025086,0.13750242,0.0641162,0.0419019,0.03443461,0.10369909,0.15301856,0.105197676,0.19984576,0.077913545,-0.06562494,-0.004235465,-0.013177678,-0.06494087,-0.09496377,-0.080544576,0.25763598,0.09797792,0.08576277,0.051232085,-0.08671105,0.054950554,0.04607646,0.10445235,0.14848334,0.0769543,0.033000655,0.34727496,0.17798425,0.022731457,0.0706577,0.13363622,0.16216901,0.27807614,0.26519665,0.13789013,0.11219354,-0.00085565075,0.02384884,0.030187577,0.10370402,0.051412433,0.113119155,-0.016837068,-0.019433549,0.024327938,-0.016314821,0.049966827,0.0207206,-0.013890436,-0.036285415,-0.055607133,0.13402148,-0.038503967,0.14125031,-0.12615106,-0.007822365,0.03005285,-0.03044271,0.10672532,0.029684799,0.07877725,0.20734571,-0.059966214,0.048922885,-0.08015065,-0.046379883,0.0023777569,0.035007574,0.023757348,0.09051667,-0.020042285,0.14508069
The value that I have always lived by is the golden rule - Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I believe in live and let live. Don't judge others if you have never walked in their shoes. Don't tell me how to live my life and I won't tell you how to live yours.,"The past 7 days have been pretty much like all my days for the past year and a half. I get up each morning, feed the cats, drink a cup of coffee while I read the morning news. Then I play solitaire for a while to get my brain going. After that I clean house, watch streaming video and work on MTurk. The only thing that was different is I spent last Friday night at my sister's house because she has a tornado shelter and we were under a level 4 risk of tornadoes. There were devastating tornadoes 30 miles south of us but we did not get any damage here.",4.333333333333333,2.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,2.833333333333333,2.1666666666666665,1.0,4.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,5.5,3.0,5.666666666666668,3.0,5.5,5.0,3.5,3.5,5.5,6.0,5,3.6666666666666665,3.5,3.6666666666666665,1,64,1,Englsih,1,2,R_1kRDIM0PDBVSf93,0.058264844,0.107234076,0.13737088,0.15852098,0.06210555,0.12590002,0.067328505,0.141159,0.10501127,0.08716023,0.02159851,0.059287094,0.21294543,0.2798772,0.14160535,0.17529562,0.12030544,0.019172598,0.009936245,0.023408424,0.08996743,0.03255496,-0.010556355,0.03906957,0.073468976,0.024815854,0.08219396,-0.0048175566,0.04365709,0.033101864,0.19357087,0.15181822,0.14930376,0.18199512,0.08335041,0.032380052,0.059185468,0.017435575,8.711219e-05,-0.03360346,-0.008107595,0.24699542,0.12469849,0.12862916,-0.021572964,-0.003160119,0.14567164,0.13165279,0.05230749,0.12607037,0.20308682,0.17558868,0.17004728,0.29301667,0.09445438,0.19761902,0.043527365,0.08612761,0.25906998,0.057724673,0.16435869,0.06252115,0.048328333,0.045017708,0.08867161,0.1858169,0.1319026,0.043432403,0.036373198,0.05660568,0.04977186,-0.021361277,-0.024431767,0.058137883,0.0069839824,-0.0595555,-0.005297715,0.016854549,-0.002362987,0.17515703,-0.11667536,-0.036458757,-0.005884316,-0.036136564,-0.050572097,-0.041045282,-0.022663739,0.117534034,-0.065152094,0.13011232,-0.070673004,0.00717403,-0.03606115,-0.030330885,-0.0464468,0.010716785,0.0029149782,-0.02379568

"My guiding principle is that i respect my elders and i dont like speaking bad about others. Even if a person is mean to me, i will not show my anger to him instead i will try to know them of why they are like this and make them feel comfortable with me. I dont get offended for silly reasons and because of this i had many opportunities to improve my career. This led to great life experience. Because of my principles, i was able to impress the girl that i love and got married together and we now have 2 kids and we both are enjoying our life and embracing all the things the life brings us.","I usually get up at 6.00 AM. I get ready for my work and then travel 36 km to get to my office in my car which is a very tiring journey because often i will get stuck in traffic. After reaching the office, i go for a rounds inside the factory and wish my superiors good morning. Then i start to check my email and then see my calendar for any meetings and will start to write the activities which i need to do today in my work. Then i will prepare presentation which i need to explain it to my boss. Then i will go for lunch in my office canteen with my colleagues which is my favourite part. Because iam an extrovert character and i love speaking with people and all my colleagues laugh at my jokes which will always make me happy. Then after lunch i will start my work and my work will be over at 5.00 pm . One day i got into an accident while going back to my home after work. This happened just 2 days back. Because of this, my car is totally damaged and i had to move it to the workshop. Now i dont have a car to travel to work. So i asked my manager permission to work from home. Yesterday i went tospiderman movie which was awesome and i had agreat time.",3.5,3.8333333333333335,4.166666666666667,3.8333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,21,4.0,5.5,3.333333333333333,2,29,1,English,1,5,R_1dlVZmM2JFzNWp5,0.13095829,0.15728006,0.24460787,0.15105656,0.17625508,0.11470821,0.11927843,0.21726255,0.19907019,0.1416517,0.0909439,0.22676732,0.086765446,0.17963342,0.13978143,0.12164071,0.15341075,0.01498692,0.07604203,0.014822595,0.036579892,-0.06886183,0.055535704,0.010461127,-0.01824174,0.10612272,0.20450717,-0.027650332,0.04162483,0.11680787,0.23576592,0.21757141,0.21316804,0.1768064,0.21854761,0.0974003,0.18368426,0.0772011,0.11084323,0.017392466,0.00038445927,0.3152063,0.18562037,0.16826656,0.22565545,-0.015676294,0.07053456,-0.015599053,0.26439372,0.23240145,0.1516847,0.19046369,0.21786629,0.21104944,0.22398074,0.29117787,0.14334625,0.17322254,0.3628761,0.24458577,0.11337798,0.09408266,0.002788825,-0.073696405,-0.05891665,0.027006889,0.026282977,0.022769038,0.006561001,-0.007332202,0.07185191,-0.00024687406,0.07249109,0.1138704,0.07483709,0.019242592,0.06737715,0.04327579,0.104623005,0.09309383,-0.14183202,-0.039548896,0.025530297,0.0053301007,0.09785393,-0.083616525,-0.015792971,0.15190038,-0.01743742,0.050073877,-0.040612735,0.07241028,-0.05377008,-0.011591211,0.014076022,0.007670015,-0.014562402,-0.040860027

"Honesty is the most important value that guides my life. I strive to be honest in everything that I do, even if the truth sometimes hurt. I do this because if I'm honest, I know why I'm doing or saying something, where if I lie, then I have to remember not only the lie, but also why I was lying in the first place.

The second important value in my life is following the rules. It annoys a lot of people and probably makes people see me as not fun, but we have rules for a reason and they should be followed. Life is better when the important rules are followed. These include do no lie, do not kill, do not steal, do not harm others, do not harm yourself, don't speed, don't do drugs, don't drive drunk or high, and so many others.

","Work has been a large part of my last seven days. My boss is out of work due to an illness and as he is in charge of our location, this is a big out. I've been coordinating with our regional vice president to ensure that all tasks and needs of our location are being met. I've also been ensuring that all invoices for payment have been entered as we near the end of the year. This is important so that the budget can be closed out quickly once we enter into 2022.

Aside from work, I've been doing some tasks here on MTurk to earn extra money. I live with my mom and step-father as a caretaker for my mom. We're middle class, but Covid has been effecting that as periodically my stepfather has been out of work. He teaches automotive repair at various sites around the country, and yet again, he has no work until January due to Covid outbreaks. This means that aside from my paycheck, we have no income coming in. I don't earn much with MTurk, but I enjoy it.

As Covid is bad in our area, I have not been going out aside from my private office on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I've been working from home, doing MTurk, and crocheting to try and finish up Christmas gifts. I also did some plastic canvas work to make a small box for my 10 year old niece. She'll love it because not only did I make it for her, but I got her favorite colors of lime green and the rainbow into it.

I've also been struggling to get our holiday lights up outside. I got the windows and door done with pine garland and lights, however the lights and the timer stopped working after two nights. Exchanging that was a pain as for now, I had to buy a third timer and will return the broken one once our Covid numbers are low again.

One thing that I've loved is cooking simple foods here at home for meals. We've had spaghetti with meat sauce, home made pizza with mini pepperonis on them, chicken noodle soup with goldfish crackers in them, and grilled cheese sandwiches. All are extremely simple, but they're also giving me time to work on my holiday craft projects.

The TV has been on some in the background, but more for noise and not because there was something we had to watch on it. There hasn't been. Most of what has been on has been cooking shows, though I did start watching a medieval history documentary.

Cat cuddles have been real this past week. The kittens especially just want to be held and scratched under the chin as they purr and purr. Our oldest cat has wanted pets too. Not as much as the kittens, and she doesn't want to cuddle, but she wants love.

Sleeping is still a problem. The vertigo and balance issues are keeping me from going up to my bed so I've been sleeping on the couch. Surprisingly the couch is comfortable and I'm not missing my bed honestly - except when the cats jump off the back of the couch onto my stomach in their quest to chase each other around the house all night at speeds faster then light. Waking up to an 8 pound cat landing on your stomach is not fun! The breath gets knocked out of you and I at least since up going OMPH!",5.0,4.166666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.8333333333333335,3.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.5,5.666666666666668,4.5,6.0,2.0,6.0,5.5,4.0,5.5,21,3.1666666666666665,3.5,2.5,1,39,1,English,1,5,R_1qVzBgPm8TEk8F0,-0.04874006,0.043070324,0.23503785,0.052941233,-0.046301197,0.1887068,0.014068985,0.012831695,0.06593852,0.08082342,-0.047516026,0.03117916,0.021054834,0.094184205,0.012535866,0.021554902,0.042314243,-0.009640027,0.15474081,0.08662643,-0.009316016,0.15609223,0.096970566,0.073916174,0.08632499,0.24399748,0.19583552,0.108561814,0.013521677,0.05159788,0.13313548,0.094792575,0.11835642,0.09938443,0.12701336,0.033577517,0.06885862,0.026988108,-0.021700393,-0.009317599,-0.022448191,0.14295834,0.07830615,0.13617453,0.06920402,-0.031260017,-0.093443334,0.02647964,6.5006316e-06,0.11693731,0.098349065,0.16179976,0.015778106,0.11166155,0.12577242,0.095669895,0.03636064,0.018749494,0.21648288,0.04300985,0.094104126,0.06583372,0.09964292,0.00782294,-0.04698348,-0.013175084,0.007884609,-0.02530206,0.13570347,0.17201973,0.1130996,0.16621584,0.1066834,0.18284664,0.21944085,0.08725664,0.19840232,-0.052705772,0.10743903,0.018251106,-0.038067095,-0.022464275,-0.045306854,-0.040794756,-0.06730188,-0.10070457,-0.012895003,0.0448306,0.027801394,0.0052550063,0.019606208,0.038886752,-0.092167154,0.023329135,-0.101935185,-0.052775726,-0.07690085,-0.14028499
"I value my independence.  It helps me evaluate myself in relation to others.  This independence allows me to look carefully at my actions and my needs.  It has helped me to realize that if I observe myself enough, I realize I don't need to do a lot of things other people think are necessary.  For instance, marriage.  I am able to occupy myself with the making of art works and reading, allowing me much time to think about the decisions I've made in life.","I have done mundane things like cooking and cleaning the house.  Other things include drawing and painting, looking through my photos of Canyon de Chelly to get ideas for what to paint next,  looking at art books for inspiration, looking at youtube videos of art supplies and techniques, watched a Nature program in Finland, emailed friends, checked Instagram and Facebook for art work, taken care of my houseplants.",3.333333333333333,2.5,2.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,2.0,2.833333333333333,3.333333333333333,4.5,2.0,5.333333333333333,3.0,5.5,1.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,5,2.833333333333333,2.0,3.1666666666666665,1,73,6,English,1,5,R_8faAtbNMpv4axHP,0.03909805,0.1894948,0.18617982,0.20829585,-0.034157254,0.24200936,0.02813742,0.049532965,0.21626957,0.036906514,-0.0035872608,0.18651977,0.11828151,0.3118657,0.15956165,0.12506531,0.14018258,0.013397035,0.047550723,0.057408366,0.067802645,0.06708963,0.061381076,0.06018606,0.06764539,0.06614847,0.21678135,0.029240487,0.06334685,0.11334303,0.23005655,0.17893946,0.19550045,0.31622976,0.28088373,0.033626106,-0.0013216194,-0.024855662,-0.030359402,-0.11726597,0.018454317,0.46316066,0.13160063,0.2613766,0.15520605,-0.0643373,0.12112877,0.15797773,0.362274,0.25070703,0.1329374,0.07576439,0.26698548,0.45383576,0.07452318,0.15939903,0.14324047,0.25189424,0.24618526,0.29954258,0.30848598,0.04084969,0.09113997,0.055549607,-0.0043017073,0.104041465,-0.023971826,0.05187895,0.08103941,0.004702611,0.074976355,0.06159492,0.0077024475,0.03774767,0.07180253,0.042810176,0.107638106,0.12213282,0.07833996,0.07192339,-0.121310145,-0.020275105,0.0924568,-0.06796186,0.030874044,-0.0757733,0.08114008,0.18137896,-0.013238145,0.08969843,-0.033693966,-0.041220013,-0.034777574,0.006182594,-0.06823217,0.019777171,0.005304627,0.04090708
My most central values is being a great parent to my children. Being kind and good hearted even when others are not. Taking care of people makes me happy.,"This past week I have woken me an my children up, made breakfast and then start working from home. Once I am done working from home I then take my children outside to play. I put them down for their naps and then finally, I have some alone time.

"The most important values that guide my life revolve around my family.  My husband, my kids, and our life together drive me to do everything I do.  They make me want to live, love, and be a better person.  I think of them with every decision I make.  I feel a strong marriage is so important to show our children.  My husband and I treating each other with respect and showing equality in our marriage show our kids how to have a healthy relationship.  Being a present mom, who listens to her kids and tries to give them the tools they need to make good life decisions, is very important to me.  I feel my life significantly changed after meeting my husband and getting married.  But once I had kids, I felt like an actual different person.","Last Friday, I made Christmas cookies with a couple of my girlfriends.  It was fun to catch up with them as we haven't seen each other in awhile.  Then I worked a little before the kids got home from school.  We had dinner and watched a movie together.  Saturday the kids and I made sugar cookies to decorate, then went to a family friend's house for a Christmas party.  We had a great time.  Sunday our son had a soccer game and our other son had baseball practice.  Monday our daughter came down with something so she had to miss 2 days of school but thankfully no one else got sick.  I picked up balloons and party decorations for my son's birthday the next day.  Tuesday was my son's 11th birthday and we celebrated him after school with his favorite dinner and dessert.  Wednesday was a good day because I accomplished my goal of running four miles.  I also did the usual housework and finished up Christmas shopping and wrapping.  Thursday I went with my husband to Costco for food for the holidays and other things we needed.  We are hosting a New Years party so we bought things for that.  Tonight we will be going out to dinner with our friends and I'm looking very forward to it.",4.666666666666667,1.8333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,3.0,2.1666666666666665,3.0,3.333333333333333,3.5,4.0,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.5,2.0,5.0,4.5,3.5,5.0,17,2.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,1,40,1,English,1,5,R_3hfP82OnuKOBVcP,-0.016637474,-0.014399711,0.13668686,0.00069516525,0.011578986,0.09320418,-0.02916409,0.09784476,0.061325878,0.12896207,-0.116528414,-0.050231334,0.05670353,0.12386904,0.005657222,0.029473968,-0.02320484,0.011171533,-0.13637719,-0.014674902,0.013239883,-0.008854559,-0.04629831,0.00662723,-0.0027355421,0.08078164,0.041112933,0.026759492,-0.039720517,-0.04622779,0.077378996,0.21669114,0.11509159,0.048294574,0.042288564,-0.12950285,-0.06360868,-0.04851571,-0.17305061,-0.087314814,-0.16482213,0.25266132,0.042050775,-0.01328662,0.009183411,-0.11985474,-0.10098714,0.018511392,0.0064956956,0.069901824,-0.055447415,-0.050405007,0.19951342,0.14417627,0.067912996,0.07933212,0.059059307,0.019224465,0.24011831,0.10245914,0.032680918,0.08273981,-0.048110545,-0.039084136,-0.051304817,-0.042957284,0.0014013089,-0.001680065,0.002012359,-0.073673226,0.010451086,-0.02776849,0.09064212,-0.06000169,-0.03456545,-0.0057906043,-0.05450082,-0.054075174,-0.09825538,0.0084367655,-0.038561232,-0.10978998,-0.06292594,-0.050488487,0.014680902,0.018990993,-0.06034593,0.111448236,0.09068002,-0.021756528,-0.00019409508,-0.07131565,-0.06504491,-0.03497933,-0.10359306,-0.051402546,-0.09899268,-0.06838027
"My central values revolve around how I want to feel expressed yet also express kindness towards others. I aim to become a more level headed person even amongst the craziest of stressful times. I need to have time to do the things I love to make sure that I can become recharged and bring about my best self to the people I interact with, especially towards those that are closest to me. Other values that guide my life are revolving around fairness to myself and other people. These values relate to me and who I am as a person. They provide a template for who I aim to be like.","For the past seven days, I have had a pretty regular schedule. I have been going to work for the past few days.

"Treat people with respect and dignity. Compete as hard as you can for the things you want out of life and don't stop until your succeed. Protect yoiur family from and and all evil and be willing to take a bullet for them. Family to me is not dictated by blood it is loyalty. Loyalty is one of the most important qualities that someone can have in my opinion. I have very few people that I consider loyal to me and that is the way I want it. Trust is yours until you break it. Once you break trust it is almost impossible to get it back from me. Let people be whoever they want to be. There is no normal for who a person should live by, only the normal they feel for themselves. Conservatives are some of the most judgmental people on earth and is is really disturbing. The last administration almost ruined our nation and a change was much welcomed by me. Your God is your God and doesn't have to be mine. You can believe in whatever you want to and that is ok with me. I think that white people take freedoms they don't even know they have for granted and it makes me sad. I believe there is systemic racism throughout just about every platform in America and throughout the world.",I have gone to Panera everyday to get a free bagel. I also picked up my wife a free hazelnut coffee while I was there. One of the days I took my son to Panera and we sat down to eat. I had my usual asiago bagel and he had a blueberry muffin. I have brushed my teeth each morning and taken my medicine. I grilled a bunch of chicken for me and my wife to have for lunches this week. We made tacos for two of the days and another day I used the rest to make a chicken quesadilla. We have had various things for dinner each night but nothing memorable. I have gone to the golf course to practice almost each day. I have done some Mturk work and some Appen work on the computer everyday this week. I checked my emails everyday and responded to the ones I needed to.

"My goal in life is to be the best version of myself that I can be. I aim to be happy with whatever is thrown my way and to never let things keep me down. I live for improving myself and my capabilities for myself rather than for monetary gain. I pursue knowledge and, while it may sound silly to some, enlightenment. I care not for financial stability and security, I don't want lavish luxury and power. I want happiness and a feeling of fulfillment in my short life, I want it to be the best it can be. I aim to master myself and my actions. To have strength over my emotions rather than the other way around.","I have worked on illustrations for clients, had my work rejected and our ties cut off. It was dumb because I was offering them a service that they couldn't even afford but I was still willing. I have worked on MTurk, and I have been creating an illustration for my mother. Yesterday I had a lovely dinner with my family, my partner has been in a funk recently and that has made things tough between us. Now she's going to be gone for the whole weekend and I'll be all by myself. Each day I try to figure out something new to do. Something to keep me afloat. But I also get distracted by other responsibilities as well as just enjoying my dull life.

"Integrity and groundedness.  

Telling the truth and learning how to navigate life with others in it have taught me that most often, at least for me, the cleanest and fastest outcome comes from telling the truth, and living that truth regardless of whether anyone sees it or acknowledges it.  This practice has led me to something more important over the years, and that's groundedness.  Being truthful to myself and others about everything, even if there are unfavorable consequences has allowed me to become more aware of my surroundings simply by being more aware of people and their feelings.  I have to see it, feel it, be part of it, and accept the good and the bad.

Just making people more ""real"" has afforded me the opportunity to pull my head out of abstractions and intangibles and remember that I'm on a little piece of the universe, surrounded by all of that infinite unknown in all directions, where I get to experience good weather, sunsets, trees blowing in the wind, cuddling, good food, and art. 

It comes with pain, but that's okay.  It's all part of it, and it's just as much part of it to make it as close to heaven on earth as possible by reducing that pain for each other.  

For me, that starts with just simply having integrity and showing people that I care enough about them to be honest and treat them with compassion.","Most of my days currently consist of taking care of my father.  As in, my days are the same for months at a time.  

My day starts with getting up and getting on MTurk to try and bring in any kind of supportive money to help while I spend all my time taking care of him.  I usually make breakfast after, then start the rest of my day, which is doing everything necessary to start my own business.  The past few years have been devoted exclusively to learning Adobe Suite products like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects.  I'm currently taking courses on web design (HTML/CSS/Java) and have locally created most of my own website that I'm trying to finish up to get up and start making some passive income from.  Towards the end of the day, I exercise and shower, eat dinner, then hang out with friends online because it's the pandemic and I don't work and can't spend money anyway.

Although it doesn't seem like much, my activities total to 10-12 hours of work if not more, one hour for exercise if it wasn't taken up by work, then the rest is for myself or extra help for my father until bed.",4.666666666666667,1.5,4.166666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.0,1.8333333333333333,4.166666666666667,3.6666666666666665,6.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,4.5,4.5,5.5,5.5,7,3.333333333333333,3.5,3.8333333333333335,2,40,6,english,13,4,R_3kInyRgxt693aIx,-0.05857101,0.13996959,0.24498957,0.08646571,0.007458953,0.3396024,-0.0076128505,-0.05784413,0.13734573,0.094596356,-0.02180622,0.16905922,0.07193216,0.26006785,0.01760404,0.11976738,0.10493522,-0.005465865,0.03939946,0.031418428,0.024942584,0.17104977,0.006343674,0.105437316,0.080899365,0.14897159,0.18707156,0.098836675,0.037133384,0.08252835,0.11025838,0.12406485,0.15733658,0.11594473,0.21782838,0.0065080235,0.013249963,-0.027497755,-0.044427287,-0.08574379,-0.0275666,0.23138341,0.10346992,0.23889105,0.07427312,-0.03246256,-0.098794304,0.04100938,0.12471336,0.20291618,0.057215545,0.0036618803,0.0048551373,0.27732852,0.082997225,0.12638997,0.065537825,0.15490887,0.20224997,0.15107033,0.14888269,0.10590732,0.065959476,0.0061803362,0.017365653,0.00819238,0.0129017,0.014790928,0.1697922,0.14769362,0.19777605,0.2031067,0.079883374,0.117168635,0.2347847,0.078590736,0.103804484,-0.06914703,0.13445972,-0.0036028046,-0.019219667,-0.093300514,0.014500637,-0.040218852,-0.032896463,-0.028651018,0.04117791,0.13291864,0.1360365,0.09558375,-0.0027223565,0.043211453,-0.051046602,0.009775218,-0.17308119,-0.052111864,-0.014427239,-0.06411945
"I have what I call ""The Pillars of Success in Life"".

1. God
2. Health
3. Family
4. Friends
5. Hard Work
6. Interaction with The Natural World
7. Learning
8. Teaching
9. Giving
etc.

There are many but the ones listed above are some of the most important ones.

I use The Basic 3 Love Rule to guide everything I do.

1. Love God
2. Love Yourself - The humble type of love for self.
3. Love Others as you Love Yourself

I have practiced them and have realized that they come in that order. In other words, I must first Love God in order to Love Myself. I must Love God and Love Myself (the humble type) in order to Love Others as Love Myself.

These 3 Loves are very easy to understand and ""to see"". The hardest one, at least for me and for many people in my life, ""Love Others as you Love Yourself"" is by far The Hardest One of the 3 Loves. Very hard at times, especially for those we see as ""Unlovable"". 

After the 3 Loves, I think everything, including the 3 Loves, are based on Relationships. That is the key. We have relationships in our immediate and extended families, our neighbors, at school, at work, in our community, our Healthcare Providers, etc. Relationships are everything.

Now, Relationships are maintained and grow by communicating. Listening is the most important aspect of communicating. Most of us are really bad at listening. Especially active listening.

I also believe in interacting and taking care of the Natural World and all Living Things. Admiring them, respecting them, understanding that we are a part and not above The Natural World.  My parents have taught us that we must leave the world better than we found it. Improve it. Don't make it worse. 

Learning is a must and we all do it to some extent. But, teaching, or sharing what we learn is the next most important part of learning. Just learning is not enough. We can ""hoard"" knowledge and think we have the upper hand for doing so but no. It is actually the opposite. Because, others will not share their knowledge with us if we ""hoard"". And, more importantly, what we learned was written or said by others, for the most part. Also, teaching or sharing reinforces what we learn and makes it ""stick"". It also increases our Networks and keeps us more connected.

My oldest brother taught me, mostly through his actions, the 3 S's of money. 

1. Save Some
2. Share Some
3. Spend Some

With these 3, and in that order, we will have enough money. I can tell you that it works. I have seen it work in his life, in my life and in the lives of others in our circles. 

I value my Health and know it is a Gift from God and is not to be taken for granted. Health and Wellness make everything better and easier (not easy but easier). We should eat nutritiously, exercise daily, yes daily... even a 20 min walk is exercise. We should also stay connected and interact with God, people and The Natural World. All these things bring us and give us Health. 

Laughter is very important. It literally heals (Science has proven it). We must keep that ""Childlike"" aspect of our lives and have fun. As adults, we are very serious due to work, responsibilities, marriage, children etc. That is true. But we must have fun with those around us and always be willing and able to laugh.","These past 7 days I worked for 5 days in my regular job. It is very challenging and satisfying. Our work and the people we work with are ""like our second family"". Work and the relationships at work and belonging to a Big Group with a common cause brings me great satisfaction and identity.

I also go to the LA Fitness gym about 4-5 times week to do Cardio Workout, Lift Weights and to Play Basketball. I also socialize with my gym friends and acquaintances and with the gym Staff. The gym is a big stress reliever for me and brings me good Health. My connections and relationships at the gym are unique and ""Athletic"". We all have a common interest. Sports and being and staying in shape.

I also go to the local park with my girlfriend. We do this about 3-4 times a week and for about 45-60mins on weekdays and for about 1-1.5hrs on weekends. This is a great time to walk and talk outside with the trees and the wind around us. Really good way to see things from a different perspective. Our conversations are somewhat different when we ""talk while we walk"". It's one of our sayings...""talk while we walk"". Very different than talking in the car, at home, in a restaurant etc.

I keep in touch with close friends and with extended family through Social Media, phone calls, facetime etc.  This is very important to me and I make time, even if it's just a 15-20 min phone call or a quick 5 min text.  I'm an Extra Extrovert and simply enjoy talking and interacting with people from All Walks of Life. 

Some of the Social Activities are limited now due to the Delta and Omicron Variants. This whole Pandemic that started around Feb 2020 has impacted All The World and has limited a lot of our Social Interactions, at least the physical ones. I have kept, we have kept an eye on the current Omicron Variant. About 90% of my immediate and extended family and my friends believe in The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Vaccines. We are all fully vaccinated and in the process of getting our Boosters. We stay informed, share the info with one another, encourage each other and provide help finding Booster Shot locations, Appointments etc.

We are not discouraged and we don not live in a world of ""doom and gloom"". We simply stay informed, Trust but Verify the information and follow the Science. We are lucky to have some Doctors, Nurses and Pharmacists in our Extended Family.

I am looking forward to our Annual Family Christmas Gathering. Some will attend in person and others will be via Zoom/FaceTime. It's due to the Delta and Omicron Variant.

"I try to put myself in other shoes to understand them before responding to deep ideas. General conversation isn't really important yet I still strive to be supportive of the people I interact with. But if the conversation is intense I try to slow my response in order to recognize how someone is feeling. I try my best not to offend people on ideas they have that are different than mine. And to support people in their beliefs. 
I alsotry not to involve people in any issues I am going through. So as to only provide positive interactions as much as possible.",I started working on my Christmas list. I went through the possibilities and engaged in conversations with people to get the best value for my money. I also started to decorate for Christmas. Setting my house in order for guests. Putting up the tree. Decorating the hose. Cleaning up the yard. Like mowing and weeding. I had to blow off leaves numerous times to sustain the kept up appearance as well. I spent a lot of time working obviously. But the down time was divided between these important holiday related tasks and decompressing time from the pressure. Work life balance played a key role in my activities this week.,4.0,1.8333333333333333,3.5,3.0,3.333333333333333,1.5,3.1666666666666665,3.333333333333333,5.0,3.5,4.333333333333333,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,17,3.333333333333333,3.0,2.5,1,52,1,English,1,3,R_Td74XbqTv7PFx6N,0.054076385,0.22625497,0.2193447,0.18352762,0.07715146,0.24980623,0.14350799,0.13568366,0.24195445,0.1299538,0.031338364,0.2500019,0.19878644,0.32318744,0.09300571,0.18340918,0.22729075,-0.010868477,0.005863134,0.0623543,0.12877655,0.11665206,-0.0052216575,0.1051739,0.17369567,0.20706281,0.24124044,0.074235454,0.072837554,0.09785581,0.24579938,0.14758906,0.19038099,0.26983562,0.22471374,-0.024465589,0.067265,-0.033892438,-0.03737132,-0.11009283,0.0028554192,0.3325747,0.1880683,0.29653978,0.24504218,0.08404249,0.15079448,0.048449844,0.25211197,0.33003315,0.09311706,0.05169978,0.25847372,0.34782892,0.1195167,0.2621789,0.25851995,0.27956718,0.33456102,0.2285384,0.22506112,0.19307943,0.14982033,0.08873813,0.012164136,0.0986064,0.06491423,0.0550164,0.20112799,0.17587395,0.24524423,0.23876423,0.27318603,0.12313019,0.252486,0.209584,0.27897173,0.16758157,0.21742539,0.07826976,-0.080672085,-0.016862646,0.046711385,-0.083627865,0.00809682,0.085849375,0.20584214,0.33672208,0.11882531,0.05657261,0.0526973,0.12038271,-0.032537628,0.07611054,-0.10661318,-0.07711984,-0.03515871,0.021645982

"The most important values that guide my life:
Never hold a grudge against anyone. Put others first before your needs. Bear wrongs patiently, Help those in need. Provide insight and guidance to others. Act always out of charity towards others especially when they are not kind to you.  I strive to follow all Christian values and virtues each and every day and pray each day for the wisdom and courage.  Each time that i exercise a virtue such as patience, kindness, or generosity, i feel happy and try to keep up the virtue. If I feel sad or without motivation I mediate on the events in the 4 Gospels and this helps me. I always look for the most logical choice when a decision is to be made and pray about my choices. I try to be understanding and thoughtful to others.","During the past seven days i have done the following 
On Dec 10th I did not work my regular job. Instead I volunteered to help backstage with the production of a nutcracker ballet performance. I was in charge of a ""prop"" a sleigh that is used in both Acts I and II. During Act I the sleigh is changed from the brown sleigh to  a white one and I made the ""costume"" change during the act for this ""prop"". I also helped move some parts of the set during a scene change. After the show was over I drove back to my apartment and fell asleep.
On Dec 11th, I volunteered again to help backstage. I generally did the same things except there were two shows today so everything was repeated. However I did not need to help with the set change since there were more people available to help. My lower back started to hurt some during the day after I refilled some of them at the Whole Foods Grocery during the morning of the 11th.
On Sunday December 12, I also volunteered at 2 shows but these were a little earlier in the day so I arrived back at my apartment earlier than on Friday or Saturday. I also helped with the ""seligh"" ""Prop"" in both of these shows getting it changed during Act I.On
On Monday December 13,  I went back to my regular routine: getting up in the morning, eating breakfast and doing my remote work. I also took a lunch break at 12 noon on both days.
On Tuesday I drove my daughter to the ballet theater for her lesson with the artistic director and then returned to my apartment.
ON Wednesday, I also drove my daugher to the ballet for a dress rehearsal.
On Thursday I drove again to the ballet theater for the 6th show of the Nutcracker. I also volunteered backstage. My lower back continues to hurt but only in certain positions.
Now it is Friday and I am getting ready for another show. I decided to stay at a nearby hotel last night so I could be close to the theater today and not drive back late at night after the show.",4.833333333333333,2.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.5,4.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.5,2.5,4.5,24,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,2,50,1,English,1,7,R_31cOOeTEtKBITck,0.010007537,0.035813175,0.0804873,0.03598462,0.19247407,0.13007607,0.11996189,0.18785012,0.1276195,0.13508895,0.13605437,0.18749173,0.14154956,0.12600328,0.10979541,0.098198146,0.10198392,0.028700776,-0.0006136077,0.025533307,-0.011187466,0.038104966,0.015939537,-0.09783155,-0.0021400917,0.013551813,0.07092381,0.05399798,-0.04422074,-0.03701914,0.16684785,0.099209435,0.110699646,0.020320164,-0.010623996,-0.036255732,0.106022745,0.0011139531,-0.018234603,0.051408254,-0.06873088,0.11243336,0.03185564,-0.05501372,0.085586,-0.02329496,0.110318184,-0.08404282,0.111172855,0.06718379,0.013952273,0.11359249,0.11840257,0.03442511,0.16266224,0.20332743,0.10979962,0.14598091,0.190007,0.07375027,0.18852095,0.0015460849,0.037386894,-0.038527593,0.10434499,0.15469451,0.17280355,0.11260768,-0.04459978,-0.072804935,-0.02303401,-0.07033916,0.072903946,-0.015626997,0.028845554,-0.029281043,0.07866135,-0.0037552286,0.030316481,0.09529681,-0.14645174,-0.077638604,-0.08227007,-0.042174462,0.0013421457,-0.037135717,-0.087946124,0.11325452,-0.05038909,0.083079554,0.02992424,-0.0052654305,0.025214933,-0.012115018,-0.04527338,0.019009635,0.016052876,-0.13362522
"I'm not a religious person, but I do believe I have a moral compass that helps guide me through life and allows me to share many of the same values that people with religious beliefs hold dear. One of my main values is compassion because I hate seeing others struggle, so anything I can do to help ease their burdens, I will try my best to do so. Another value I believe I have is loyalty. I feel that this is a very important value that seems lost in society today, whether it's personal or professional, you should always show loyalty to those that deserve it and show loyalty in return.","I'm a very boring person, so my daily activities don't change much. Over the last seven days I wake up, skip breakfast because I'm doing al the One Meal A Day diet, then I workout, take a shower and then head to work. I'm not in a current relationship or have a bunch of friends because of my reclusive personality, so my last few days have mostly been about boring work and shopping for Christmas gifts for my nieces and nephews. I also had to groom my husky because she's currently shedding and it's a pain to deal with all her hair. When I'm not doing that, I enjoyed watching sports, such as the NFL and my San Francisco 49ers, who beat the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime on Sunday.",5.0,4.833333333333333,3.5,3.5,4.166666666666667,2.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.0,3.5,5.666666666666668,4.5,5.5,2.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,5,2.1666666666666665,2.0,4.333333333333333,2,37,6,English,2,4,R_bkIllXqc6kTC1BT,0.07937851,0.12157625,0.16692041,0.12993893,0.21724033,0.26555946,0.0728864,0.13684623,0.23586836,0.18630804,0.056601815,0.05605731,0.18168846,0.27469033,0.112006195,0.11398961,0.12178646,-0.024991756,-0.08097441,0.014373144,0.1212049,0.02568036,-0.047090825,0.07880375,0.07310015,0.0009207763,0.105681464,0.022993479,0.06711949,0.016505891,0.15900445,0.2577593,0.14453448,0.18643314,0.12497608,-0.035505332,-0.009570746,-0.01977804,-0.055391457,-0.04295748,-0.02195638,0.28297925,0.19232231,0.1572796,0.12625611,-0.032050923,0.096203916,0.118419185,0.23181105,0.1795795,0.07567072,0.025909565,0.29926762,0.36647424,0.13866822,0.24498731,0.1857644,0.18180518,0.350483,0.26759052,0.19364566,0.19921458,0.03361048,-0.0059549417,0.06551075,0.12330505,0.127774,0.12944268,0.024540694,0.0016150912,0.05984683,0.018374097,0.07451645,0.05065477,0.028796332,0.029124402,-0.007893892,0.1492446,0.061243486,0.17604882,-0.12968732,0.049773853,0.07757144,-0.047842912,0.1352225,0.14987218,0.054758824,0.23182529,0.014430001,0.05538053,-0.08525057,0.015834372,-0.0067895968,0.002684854,0.013671797,0.11838588,0.019823855,0.05694641
"I base my entire thought process about life based on the life of Jesus.  What he taught us and how we are supposed to treat each other.

He taught us to be kind to one another.   And not just to our friends and family.  Be kind, even unto your enemy.  Turn the other cheek etc.  He taught us to care about the things he cared about, which is His people.  

He taught us to have integrity.  Do not promise or swear to someone.  Let your yes be yes and your no be no.  Do not guarantee things that you have no control over.  Be honest to people about all things.

He taught us to teach our children about him and let them grow through the years learning from Him.  He wants us to teach our children about His love, the Agape love.",On last Friday I went to work all day.  I got home and had a quiet night eating supper and playing with the family.  Saturday we got up and went to town and did some shopping most of the day.  we ate out for lunch at a fast food restaurant and went and purchased clothes for the children.  On Sunday we got up earlier than usual and went to my brother-in-law's church to watch his daughter and son in a Christmas performance.  We went shopping again and made it home in time to go to our church for Sunday night service.  Monday I had my typical day at work.  When I got home I took my son to the batting cages to work on baseball since his tryouts were this week.  Tuesday-today were pretty much the same.  Work all day and play with the kids at night.  I also went to Wednesday night service at church and watch our children rehearse for their Christmas program this Sunday.,3.1666666666666665,1.5,3.0,3.8333333333333335,3.5,4.166666666666667,3.1666666666666665,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.333333333333333,4.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,27,3.333333333333333,6.0,3.0,2,41,1,English,1,5,R_1i29sugZyaWNfdL,-0.019927943,0.008337062,0.07188937,-0.030864438,0.06864215,0.16377999,0.023400297,0.040370688,0.071816325,0.06965694,-0.08372258,0.022726063,0.2766158,0.264041,0.12664337,0.11404691,0.12952767,-0.008704901,-0.13918626,-0.041554414,0.081986435,0.033713944,-0.027722877,0.045379095,0.02208676,0.02473606,0.062152095,0.096356,-0.041511603,-0.07231592,0.070677556,0.13135786,0.04700394,0.015782284,-0.018498525,-0.07412816,-0.010326764,0.0055337045,-0.11864286,-0.010934092,-0.057401292,0.1308659,0.03539788,-0.05198542,0.07035092,-0.0928306,-0.01463069,-0.095698975,0.021678925,0.11259979,-0.04035251,-0.044606276,0.057003397,0.050221145,0.13046716,0.18515868,0.095153555,0.13006139,0.15967818,0.07601986,0.06201555,0.057591483,-0.04124067,-0.039413795,-0.065469965,0.0022456162,0.013572883,0.02209178,-0.009402014,0.01289894,-0.0039940085,-0.021653345,0.10176022,0.0260421,0.04477255,-0.014215157,0.08870781,-0.012658229,0.021659449,0.06900695,-0.025507374,-0.060414046,-0.052095726,-0.06379767,-0.017228432,0.08326668,-0.034871697,0.15051337,0.11049632,0.0012702979,0.057821635,-0.011474276,-0.019835707,-0.050716855,-0.057877146,-0.0057473704,-0.1442143,-0.072071664
"When I was growing up, my parents taught me that my reputation and integrity were the two things that only I could take away from myself. I try to lead my life in such a way as to use these two attributes in every decision and interaction I have with people. I'm not perfect, I'm not the smartest or most talented person in the world, but the one thing I have some control over is my integrity. I try to make my word count. I don't make promises unless I have every intention of fulfilling them. I am honest with people. If I can't say something nice, I won't say anything. I take responsibility for my actions and decisions. If I make a mistake, I am willing to admit it.","This past week I have gone to work several days. I try to walk five miles every day and so far this week I've managed four days. I work out with hand weights in my upstairs home gym. I worked on my crafting projects and wrapped up some gifts for Christmas. I've done laundry, cooked, and cleaned the house. I've run errands, done the grocery shopping and picked up medications. I ordered some Christmas gifts on Amazon for my children. I made several phone calls to friends and family. I attended two Homeowners Association meetings. I've gone to the bank and closed out an old account. I added some new recipes to try. I read my email daily and clear out my inboxes, file important emails, and respond accordingly.",5.0,1.8333333333333333,5.0,5.0,4.666666666666667,2.833333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.5,5.0,4.0,5.5,2.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,21,3.0,5.0,4.333333333333333,1,60,1,English,1,5,R_3JrZAAMNEPSkmeU,-0.059863035,-0.024902508,0.038326282,0.07453935,0.06884912,0.26227462,-0.01567793,0.013160618,0.14155793,0.07301742,0.059008062,0.083665736,0.1053175,0.107034385,0.030852692,0.11015767,0.11671342,-0.049517356,-0.0047196187,-0.0070644952,-0.00024016201,0.0033549387,-0.036221504,-0.061927877,-0.09292661,0.044717453,0.10637553,0.029181095,-0.017771345,-0.055866785,0.038338862,0.066216394,0.07354362,0.067803845,-0.03068501,-0.06886318,-0.031697437,-0.10248691,-0.15182889,-0.097768866,-0.07611971,0.15793467,-0.037178364,-0.03810779,-0.005520966,-0.13918868,0.03788747,-0.08580962,0.02056421,0.0453211,-0.061178736,-0.002216829,0.13548094,0.12661019,0.12964001,0.13465662,0.010415105,0.13329144,0.075117595,-0.020039063,0.07901122,-0.02653895,-0.07148849,-0.09115896,-0.024432272,0.038720436,0.033272848,0.062153954,-0.015208961,0.007588924,0.008087046,-0.056158498,0.057292596,0.058728795,0.018572256,-0.029490568,0.000561215,-0.026421051,-0.0015452281,0.043680657,-0.14526394,-0.043047607,-0.04164457,-0.036635764,-0.047995344,-0.06358593,-0.15172905,0.040644765,-0.08138822,0.041364126,-0.14885816,-0.08594298,-0.16009372,-0.13891661,-0.08111188,-0.04779021,-0.011681374,-0.17543645
"I have several central and important values that guide my life.  I first value self-reflection and knowing myself.  I know that with all my flaws and judgments, I have a sense of self-awareness that I want to cultivate in my daily life so that I can become empowered to truly be aware of my thoughts and my actions, and thus be able to change things that don't serve me.  Engaging in daily meditation helps with this immensely.  To that end, I find that becoming less self-judgmental and more loving towards myself and others is a guiding principle that I want to incorporate more of in my life and interactions with others.  I also find that when I make decisions, I want to rely more on my intuition and gut-feeling, becoming aware of when something feels off or wrong versus right.  Getting into this space of awareness helps me become more empowered in making good decisions and positively impacting myself and those around me.","This last week I began each day by oil pulling with coconut oil, then carrying out my daily morning ablutions like brushing my teeth and washing my face.  I then make my bed, take the first drink of water for the day, and then eat my breakfast, which typically consists of English muffins and vegan cream cheese, and a fruit smoothie bowl.  I then get to work on my laptop at my desk at home by going online and studying.  I am studying with an online Yoga teacher training course.  I take snack and water breaks in between.  I usually eat yogurt or a sandwich as a snack.  Later I stop to take a lunch, usually consisting of a falafel burger or a rice and sprouted beans meal.  I then get back to studying in the afternoon, or I take a bit of time to meditate.  In the evenings for the last, I have prepared dinner, usually consisting of a rice and sprouted beans combo or gazpacho.  I then carry out my evening ablutions and then take a rest to watch a movie or read a relaxing book before going to bed.  On the previous night I watch a new sci-fi movie and watched an episode of an sci-fi show called ""Expanse.""",4.166666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.5,3.1666666666666665,2.5,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,12,3.0,3.0,4.5,1,32,6,Spanish,16,5,R_scVvbRmj221bQBP,0.043154236,0.07469615,0.13582593,0.07005526,0.053016588,0.09922476,-0.021012347,0.034243457,0.08525804,0.14409843,0.021001069,0.06875846,0.16462618,0.304905,0.16619748,0.19210646,0.15443793,0.011031599,-0.022342462,0.06919691,0.08034365,-0.03129816,-0.09458935,0.04379963,-0.012455742,0.033650402,0.06393091,0.023561176,0.034426082,0.054919545,0.15597537,0.19647801,0.19903852,0.15294363,0.16144939,-0.03900104,-0.052459896,-0.019027313,-0.041664377,-0.07237425,-0.063223004,0.25083652,0.04940225,0.07020746,0.01260367,-0.12161615,0.05542227,-0.011124272,0.094752476,0.114482604,0.021135058,0.024595506,0.021462262,0.13936107,0.031511445,0.18077181,0.006533444,0.12724014,0.19946307,0.12981701,0.060777627,0.02139761,-0.051059894,-0.05648639,-0.07675361,-0.038844246,0.019753618,0.04274361,-0.068884775,-0.031125559,0.04948304,-0.07832074,-0.018869475,0.0028009396,0.029562004,-0.018132688,-0.02303747,-0.034321442,-0.0472909,0.055469368,-0.045109637,-0.07688399,-0.1234164,0.015930124,-0.065150306,-0.15489756,-0.038181655,0.0711355,-0.020772867,0.044224985,-0.082935266,-0.017854083,0.021205712,-0.008129619,-0.014707807,-0.017151687,0.08355693,-0.08961158
"The guiding principles in my life are based on God and family. I focus on doing what is right, and treating people the way I would want others to treat me. It was instilled in me from a young age by my parents and grandparents to be a good person and a godly person and to live a life to be proud of and a life that is righteous.","Starting from last Friday around this same time last week, I finished up homeschooling my oldest child for the week with some simple online review of the materials that we had covered to make sure he had understood and for me to identify if there were any things I need to double back to and reinforce. My children and I took a walk, we do that every day that it’s not raining or overly cold. My oldest then was picked up by my mom for a sleepover. Over the weekend my oldest came home, I meal planned and went to Aldi for groceries, I went to Target for some assorted household items and Christmas needs. I worked out using Nintendo Ringfit. Over the past week I homeschooled every day which takes up most of my days, and I also cook 3 meals a day, exercise and have been busy wrapping presents. Yesterday I finished planning what I would be cooking for Christmas dinner so we can get those ingredients.",3.5,1.0,4.666666666666667,3.5,4.833333333333333,4.166666666666667,3.0,4.166666666666667,3.5,2.0,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,24,3.0,6.0,3.333333333333333,1,39,1,English,1,4,R_1nZ1UISphFiKu2Z,-0.02151845,0.06726493,0.18173042,0.02070586,0.03974243,0.15652546,0.0070235888,0.037892576,0.0845741,0.1555133,-0.06394815,0.07841764,0.07819508,0.17183445,0.0267751,0.12599102,0.09475361,0.016767235,-0.09814468,0.014678866,0.018424317,0.04289666,-0.005275693,0.024236333,0.06549988,0.07576649,-0.015196882,0.07477717,0.023987383,-0.01578228,0.13616365,0.12260364,0.13695319,0.09962695,0.09650026,-0.0955313,0.0016311407,-0.007825995,-0.10134114,-0.07493443,-0.09472259,0.21575359,0.05968229,0.021199517,0.011261221,-0.09199612,-0.034290787,-0.0030284282,0.084627785,0.09559075,0.0348192,0.01772482,0.14101562,0.14716378,0.07226311,0.124451235,0.10112249,0.15879591,0.20149764,0.067216925,0.09698639,0.09119062,-0.037887733,-0.036440913,-0.073958404,-0.024409464,0.019874362,-0.0012169592,-0.015880333,0.0026048366,0.060401317,0.016012445,0.07240722,-0.021861162,0.024038028,0.0100583155,-0.0132293245,-0.07280243,-0.008120133,-0.05937857,0.07300128,-0.0971454,-0.040585928,-0.022790845,-0.047179937,-0.052213635,-0.0048746085,0.1549188,0.12984541,0.107360244,0.121905535,-0.0038812235,-0.037941813,-0.019413553,-0.08065108,-0.055150956,-0.007943047,-0.054878287
My central and most important values that guide my life are simple. Everyday is a gift and sometimes I have to remind my self of that . I try to do healthy things daily and eat healthy and laugh even if its my own silly jokes. Im no saint and Im still more than capable of giving someone a piece of my mind if I perceive it necessay. I try not to be overbearing in my adult childrens lives but I do try to make sure they are living healthy. Im not overly friendly to stranger im actually slightly distrustful of them . I watch our political system and worry about America losing it Democracy it seems we are on the edge of the cliff teetering towards facisim or Replican Mafia whatever they have going. Also the cultural makeup of our country is changing and im worried about the countries ability to think rationally and not religiously.,cereal and coffee at 6am followed by surveys for at least an hour everyday. The the every morning walk with my wife which is 3.2 miles and takes about an hour . By then its lunch time we usuall eat around 11:30am and that will take a good hour after that I practice mandolin and guitar in my music room usually 2 hours. We eat supper around 4:30pm and then watch the news till 6pm - then I go to bed and watch horror movies till my wife comes in at about 7:30 pm . I might watch some of her crime serials she likes but I usually fall asleep. This is indeed my routine everyday .,2.5,1.3333333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.0,4.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,4.5,2.0,3.6666666666666665,2.5,6.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,3.5,8,3.0,3.0,3.8333333333333335,2,67,1,english,1,4,R_1Nacb6mc8iZ8TdD,0.023584768,0.10563438,0.16334318,0.1404249,0.005718861,0.18368301,0.005768841,-0.061993897,0.079235554,0.12778148,-0.024123186,0.056914568,0.27607346,0.36922824,0.05353657,0.052605353,0.056212287,-0.028760776,-0.09903771,0.008965621,0.0071204677,-0.054227743,0.022696434,0.17452884,0.05241838,0.034446098,0.09062258,0.065704614,-0.018884933,0.042178757,0.1431456,0.118251525,0.06569736,0.18640828,0.15400106,0.05736299,0.052610308,0.107666925,0.030590642,-0.024245247,0.110638894,0.20842697,0.14240988,0.14111614,0.06981495,-0.00088172685,0.03498683,0.043384477,0.12296952,0.13875055,0.0809688,0.031780295,0.11847469,0.26514766,0.11495693,0.21249644,0.0632377,0.19419846,0.32348904,0.20607641,0.22877622,0.12268217,-0.07924967,-0.07887636,-0.038523115,-0.07151168,0.025302922,-0.046405997,-0.0015785564,0.041718192,0.06825332,0.101879954,0.033180647,0.0004674662,0.07358139,0.043956473,0.028371729,-0.037831526,0.06532283,0.09384307,-0.0372,-0.12773481,0.022715002,-0.0029559098,-0.04757531,-0.11964933,0.024379347,0.17182031,0.03181252,0.045722872,-0.037217207,0.0018341765,-0.017462436,-0.0024457816,-0.0712117,0.065242276,-0.014114972,0.05061629

It is something that just comes naturally to me and that's what makes me who I am.","This week consisted of getting my kids up for school and since they are on an independent study they stay home.

"My core values as a person are to be the best mother I can possibly be and to be the best wife I can be. See I grew up with an alcoholic mother and a father that was never there for us. He was always out of town working. As I have gotten older and so has my child. I have learned things from being a child that have reminded me over and over again what to not be to my child. My parents were very abusive towards me and my siblings. Today I refuse to hit my child in anyway. Growing up back then versus growing up today is so different in so many ways. I know that I'm a great mother. I know this because my child isn't afraid of me. She isn't afraid for her well being. I do the best I can every single day for my child. I would do anything under this sun to give my child the live she deserves. I would even give my life to her, if it came down to it. 
Being a good wife. I have not always been good to my husband. I have done terrible things. Things he should hate me for. Things he should have walked away from. But he didn't. That man has stuck by me through my ugliest and my prettiest. And every since I did what I did, I have done everything in my power to make it up to him. I can't explain the feelings I have for my husband, we'd be here all day, but just know I can't live without this man. He has pulled me out of the worst of the worst mental states I have ever experienced. For that I own this man my life. I live everyday to do what I can to make him happy. I do everything I can, so he doesn't have to. I would walk through hell if I knew he didn't have to. I would also give my life for that man. He has loved me like no other person on this planet has. And let me tell you, I love him like no other on this planet. And I will continue to do so, till my last breath.","A week ago today was Friday. So to start off I woke up and made myself a cup of coffee. After my coffee was done I proceeded to wake my daughter up and get her ready for school. After she was done getting ready for school and ate breakfast we were off to the bus stop. At the bus stop we talk about what she is going to do in school and how she is going to act at school. During the day, while she is at school, is when I get all my house chores done. My house chores consist of me taking the dog out 3 times a day, washing clothes for myself, my husband and my daughter, washing dishes, putting dishes away, cooking dinner, cleaning the floors, scooping the cat boxes, feeding the cats and if I have time, I try and squeeze a nap in there. When my daughter arrives home from school, me and her together will eat a snack out of her snack box. After she gets that done we start on homework. Her homework includes me and her reading either one or two books together and then she will take a test on the books that we read together. I will sit with her in case she needs any help. Normally she doesn't. But I am there if she needs me. After homework is done, me and her will start on our chores. At this specific time of day I know what I have to do and she knows what she has to do. So she goes on and does her thing, while I go and do my thing. After chores are done, I will start on dinner. While I'm cooking dinner I normally wash dishes as I dirty them from cooking. If my husband is home we will sit down together with no phones or electronics. But normally it's just me and my daughter. She prefers that we eat together but with electronics. So during this time, I will watch Netflix and she will watch YouTube. After we have ate our dinner we tend to sit there for awhile watching whatever it is we are watching. Mainly for our food to settle. Another because we don't really want to do anything else for the day. We've both had long and stressful day, so it's nice to just sit and watch something on our phones or tablets. But eventually we have to get back to reality and finish up our chores and get ready for the end of the day. The end of the day entails her taking a bath and me taking a shower. After that I put my daughter down in bed for the night. I usually finish up and chores I have not finished or gotten to for the day, while I wait for my husband to get home from work. When he gets home, I sit with him for a few hours and we talk about our day. How his day was at work and how my day was at home. After that I get myself ready for bed and my husband tucks me in for the night. I wake up the next morning and do it all over again. See I'm a stay at home mom, I don't get out much and I don't really have time for hobbies or interest.

"I'm a college student and that is my driving force. My family grew up not having much so my goal is to not repeat the cycle. I have made many connections while in school and have been doing volunteer work in my field. My ultimate goal is to get to a point, financially, to where I am stable and can help others with any disposable income that I have.   I like networking, though it can be tiring, but it's all in order to reach my goal.","Last Thursday, I woke up around 6:30, the usual time, and took a shower. I got dressed and headed out of my dorm to get a bite to eat. I stayed in the cafeteria and checked my phone every now and then. By 9, I left and went to the library on campus to get some last-minute studying in. My exam was at 1:15 so I stayed and studied until 1. I went, took my last exam for the semester and by 3, I went back to the room, grabbed my suitcase that I packed the day before, locked up my room, and checked out for the semester. I hopped on the bus and went to the train station before hopping on the train and leaving by 6:20. I got home around 8 and had dinner with my family before unpacking and going to bed around 9:30

Every other day, oddly enough, has been the same. I wake up, shower, get dressed, play Xbox, eat breakfast alone, play Xbox, eat lunch alone, play Xbox, clean the house until 6-6:20 when both parents arrive home, help cook, eat dinner with family, we talk for a bit, they go to bed, I stay up until 9 before I go to bed.",4.833333333333333,4.5,3.8333333333333335,2.1666666666666665,2.833333333333333,1.8333333333333333,4.5,4.333333333333333,4.5,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.5,5.5,4.5,4.0,6.0,5.5,21,3.0,2.0,2.833333333333333,2,35,1,English,2,6,R_2sSYja5WD2kXvkZ,0.018789455,0.009251809,0.113189995,0.07270557,0.10949494,0.11092131,0.024185553,0.12465603,0.1275655,0.11832462,0.028950453,0.0069526173,0.044788077,0.1348763,0.12295522,0.0823151,0.0034061708,0.08491001,-0.025735103,0.01917739,0.044080347,-0.012213481,0.0068702083,0.0040293615,-0.028415488,0.014385123,0.08490516,0.15298054,0.023463601,0.005115675,0.11064574,0.19341895,0.08489949,0.042883515,0.033073064,0.014354791,0.034973107,0.023580473,-0.012660998,-0.04395228,-0.017838523,0.15212344,0.07233263,-0.034428008,0.010522654,-0.08061047,0.01557973,-0.049066868,0.016608896,0.040717475,0.020580709,0.013196282,0.0910219,0.08051944,0.11180936,0.14200506,0.027488116,0.106835335,0.24280652,0.070735484,0.040892035,0.07856877,-0.045396358,-0.06456955,-0.021272331,0.055338107,0.12610048,0.008622438,-0.014394486,-0.028676515,0.037750956,-0.031193651,0.06598282,0.008487621,-0.0009156298,-0.030550059,-0.06502735,-0.022015428,0.013175006,0.13980459,-0.047069047,-0.048481576,0.012528997,-0.014235681,0.034577418,-0.026192907,-0.07370082,0.09845249,0.08930065,0.08634882,-0.054896772,-0.056055337,-0.040008552,-0.017896855,-0.023556659,0.019774197,-0.075889945,0.005562242
"Honesty is one of the most important values because it says everything you need to know about someone. Treating people how they deserve to be treated is another one of my most important values - if someone doesn't deserve my trust and kindness, then I move along. Being humble is another main value of mine because arrogance is disgusting and it's important to me for people, including myself, to stay humble and not be showy and have a big ego.","I attended a concert of one of my favorite singers with the local orchestra. I got dinner out but to-go because of the pandemic on that night as well. I went to the library to pick up some books I had on hold there. I read a lot because I'm trying to reach my reading goal by the end of the year. I showered multiple times. I did yoga every day. I made breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day.

"Family is most central, most important part of my life. I grew up without a good strong family unit, so keeping what I have built, my family, together and safe is my biggest goal. Faith, Family, and God. Those are my guiding principals. I try to be the best mom and wife I can be, I am not perfect, but this is what matters most to me. I also try to be the kindest, most patient grandma to my granddaughter. I know she has a lot of people who love her, but gramma's are different. The love is completely different. I just try my hardest to provide stability, warmth, and love to all those in my life. God is very important to me. Without HIM I wouldn't be where I am today. He is amazing and His love is evident to me daily, even though I fail and am undeserving, His love is completely unconditional.","Last week at this time, I was calling people to renew their business licenses. After work, I picked up my granddaughter for a sleep over. We went to the store, ate dinner, played, and she finally went to sleep very late. She woke up super early Saturday morning, and we played more until her mom wanted her back. On Sunday, it was a lazy day, my husband, son, and I stayed home in our pj's and just enjoyed the day. On Monday, the work week resumed with more calls to businesses that needed to renew their license, and more package delivery tracking. I am still missing a few packages that have yet to be delivered. I was able to get several marked off the list. After work, I picked up the grand baby for a little gramma time and took her home around 7 p.m. then I came home and watched football with my husband. Tuesday through Friday were almost identical to my Monday.

"One of my central values is to treat people the way that I want to be treated. When people are rude and mean or don't agree with me, I try to make sure the way I behave towards them reflects respect. I feel that this may be a way to be a positive influence on others. That perhaps they will see that there is no need to be rude or argumentative. It is important to me that there is peace and calmness in my life. If this means walking away from arguments, then that is what I do. It is important to me that I follow the rules of social norms as much as I can. I do not want to offend anyone or make them feel uncomfortable. I value other people and their feelings.","I went to work 4 days and after work on each of those days I came home and took a shower and then made dinner for my husband and myself. After dinner we would relax and watch some TV for a little while.  I took my dog for a walk and played with him for a bit. On my first day off, I went Christmas shopping and grocery shopping, I cleaned the house and did laundry.  The next evening, my husband and I started putting together a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle. We have worked on that puzzle every evening after dinner for the past 3 nights.

"One of my core values is to do best not to judge. Have empathy. Although everyone judges to a certain degree, it is important not to let any preconceived judgements cloud your perception of who someone really is and their potential. I grew up abused and bullied due to being a bit different in things I liked, styles I enjoyed, and hobbies. It affected me for the rest of my life. In my earlier years, I coped with what happened to me by using drugs, which led to an addiction. I am now 4 years sober, and I often see how people at their lowest are judged. People look at me and see someone strong, but sometimes they don’t know my past and make comments about people who are just like how I used to be. It’s important to me to speak up for them, and show that everyone has value. Just because someone doesn’t fit your idea of a successful life, or doesn’t fit your religious checkpoints - they are not less than you. Everyone has value and potential, and until we as a society can openly take a look at what causes addiction and other behaviors society looks down on - we won’t ever be able to reduce it. Instead of looking at people as hopeless or wastes of life, people need to have some empathy and ask what got them to that point, and lend out a helping hand.","I have been working mostly, Monday through Friday. I work at a bubble tea shop, and I also have been training in an employee on how to close. I got a new Gaming PC, so every night after work I’ve been playing 7 Days to Die with my friend. It’s been a lot of fun. Then on Thursday, my boyfriend had court so we drove up there. It took a long time due to the wait times, so I went Squishmallow hunting. I collect Squishmallows for fun, and whenever I’m in a new area I tend to drive around local stores and see which ones they sell. Then today, I went on Amazon Mturk due to finances. Any bit helps, and I often have fun doing the surveys or tasks.",4.833333333333333,2.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,1.3333333333333333,1.1666666666666667,3.8333333333333335,3.1666666666666665,5.5,3.5,5.666666666666668,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,5.0,9,3.333333333333333,1.5,3.333333333333333,1,22,7,English,1,2,R_1pyzcLSB2YarH0G,0.009896715,-0.02393406,0.2179941,0.14728804,0.059422486,0.20274682,0.03248849,0.017374013,0.16919188,0.14522605,0.030718543,0.11777274,0.106090605,0.16905898,-0.018709645,0.095832184,0.0873005,0.016396815,0.020740647,-0.050703064,0.026994692,0.03651385,0.11347443,-0.035049643,-0.008522537,0.056577135,0.28284943,-0.010353643,0.014606189,0.010676159,0.14931515,0.18570349,0.115860805,0.21741207,0.09438254,-0.038894374,0.0029747915,-0.030473877,-0.09291822,-0.06318479,-0.087924644,0.26550478,0.12146153,0.1269853,0.09185445,-0.12219584,0.023856258,-0.0077951318,0.07754596,0.14851916,0.04714413,0.02021966,0.22706717,0.3348591,0.14568783,0.13885057,0.049204648,0.082938194,0.28711116,0.119119145,0.23244491,0.14899084,0.0055362713,-0.04687124,-0.038093384,0.029683365,0.03321446,0.047744308,0.035067186,-0.067388944,0.015173396,0.007768372,0.04255727,0.11220451,0.0761754,-0.060241766,0.026156085,-0.023917641,0.034508258,0.123471186,-0.14782794,-0.050611433,0.024267808,-0.069124095,-0.011034891,-0.03881959,-0.12569244,0.010585514,-0.058593437,0.017960828,-0.1033209,-0.077669784,-0.17233321,-0.063007094,-0.06425582,0.04344323,-0.11822388,-0.111758634
"Caring for my family is my most basic value. They are the most important things in the world to me. Most of my decisions are made based on what is the best for them and what will make them happy. Our home is also important to me and keeping it in good condition so it can provide shelter for us and so it is a happy place is high on my list of priorities. Sometimes I forget my most important values and begin to focus on other outside things that do not matter as much as my family. I have to be brought back to my senses and put them at the top of my list, where they belong and should always be. My family makes me who I am.","I woke up not feeling well and sprayed my house with Lysol. I moved from my bed to the couch, I remained as far away from everyone as I could in my small house.

I get up to go into the bathroom, I spray everything down with Lysol on my way out and I come back to the couch. I have watched TV and talked on the phone. One day I did my nails.

I took care of my home (dishes, sweeping, cleaning surfaces, etc.)On a gaily basis I showered, did my hair, got dressed and fixed and consumed meals.",4.666666666666667,2.5,2.0,1.3333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,1.5,4.666666666666667,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.666666666666668,3.0,4.5,6.0,2.5,4.0,2.5,4.0,16,3.1666666666666665,1.5,2.0,1,59,1,English,2,6,R_1LLMQZadrrHXhQn,0.06916863,0.20659661,0.20097345,0.14456698,0.020500202,0.23257686,0.1956932,0.14086835,0.17446345,0.15480332,0.057398356,0.18852651,0.17182681,0.31186485,0.184171,0.087742,0.06532237,0.055182435,0.08550047,0.06842656,0.123560704,0.21152642,0.0914945,0.089486,0.091749445,0.24163127,0.18268567,0.18812832,0.048089378,0.044891436,0.25036222,0.034707442,0.0005213544,0.22155285,0.15027961,0.028139204,0.085831255,0.05636563,0.024251327,-0.11255296,0.06299019,0.15545297,0.14355893,0.2246077,0.1896578,0.15362118,0.06629419,0.24909553,0.22232491,0.24615054,0.20386875,0.23837204,0.104739316,0.22349033,0.10797727,0.22692348,0.13020478,0.21534662,0.27539003,0.26541024,0.34802508,0.17326164,0.26547173,0.19166595,0.09063677,0.15771247,0.044006288,0.06482893,0.1152966,0.11174887,0.18418308,0.13186152,0.04130958,0.031176653,0.034304667,0.1026009,0.1046052,0.0703761,0.108316004,0.097481206,0.017621852,-0.009170264,0.06814005,-0.027177092,-0.024163209,0.00010082126,0.11193322,0.23750103,0.12968098,0.109378144,0.10726888,0.05577839,0.13388877,0.099568605,-0.05940249,0.045563754,0.02048955,0.12644164
"My central and most important value is compassion, which I try to practice in every aspect of my life. Not causing other beings pain and relieving their suffering whenever I can is my lifes purpose and mission. I am a committed vegan, a rescuer of animals and an advocate for their wellbeing. I'm interested in politics and feel it is one of the best ways to care for my fellow human beings, so I consider myself very liberal in my views. I believe in standing up for the underdog and always align myself with disadvantaged groups. While I value cooperation, community and global citizenship, I'm also highly individual in my personal life. I believe people should have the right to live authentically and in a way that is most true to themselves.","The last seven days have been mostly filled with everyday activities. I wake up with the sun, take my dog outside for walks, and because we finally got some snow she has loved playing in it, making our walks a little longer. I also care for my daughters two cats while she is in London. I spend a lot of time on my computer, mainly socializing with friends and family. This is better done online now that we are in the middle of a global pandemic. My sister sent me a link last Sunday for an app that allows me to earn cash back by submitting my shopping receipts, so I signed up for that. On Monday my other sister introduced me to a free online TV/movies streaming platform that I have been enjoying. I got the news last Tuesday that a long time family friend passed away, so I sent my condolences to her daughter and got the funeral details so I can attend. Last Wednesday and Thursday we had a thunderstorm here in Minnesota, a rare thing to happen in December. It was followed by a first time ever occurance...extreme tornadoes, two of them, touching down in two different towns and causing much damage. Although we do get tornadoes in Minnesota in the summer, it has NEVER in recorded history happened in December. Today I will finished some house cleaning and then went to the grocery store.",5.0,4.833333333333333,1.5,1.8333333333333333,2.333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,2.0,6.0,3.5,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,6,3.5,1.0,3.6666666666666665,1,51,6,English,1,3,R_9ZeHVk3UYW1qk4F,0.058640342,0.03375072,0.12785733,0.11683658,0.067580156,0.259752,0.03791421,0.16666038,0.18000026,0.09055784,0.034152348,0.10934157,0.12053241,0.15444256,0.06562326,0.10365902,0.10767248,0.05237997,0.097914286,0.05065674,0.07651678,0.09458516,0.06596441,0.048844714,0.014261272,0.060100533,0.16525723,0.12505034,0.04157636,-0.021399217,0.1279678,0.15845147,0.10426356,0.059274446,0.023668045,0.10891139,0.09379573,0.06570741,0.0063265776,0.041045263,0.03333065,0.17978871,0.0493749,0.08854367,0.08240811,-0.044063948,0.020971958,0.091283455,0.046194654,0.07124437,0.1482369,0.18408374,0.15422139,0.2298694,0.18990892,0.11118004,-0.024392039,0.09465752,0.2309562,0.046733674,0.14558999,0.08662025,0.11419774,0.016786698,0.081303455,0.187496,0.15041965,0.06152141,0.055159412,-0.00038050115,0.042813156,0.05271207,0.014324104,0.13390711,0.035607234,-0.044535488,-0.057463635,-0.020779364,0.017615475,0.03734397,-0.10736559,-0.01510486,0.05914406,-0.010497094,0.0018403418,-0.013746783,-0.06236653,0.059231833,0.0005694032,0.121184565,-0.070982516,-0.03296414,-0.0933442,-0.04042639,-0.045997307,0.06406681,-0.07221032,-0.047824774
"I have a personal relationship with God and that guides my moral life.  I follow God's principles as much as I can while not requiring anyone else to do so.  However, when interacting with people I do not apply God's principles because no one else does, even though they claim that they believe in God.  The only way to speak to people is to pretend that I am an atheist because they will not understand God's principals.  I will interact with people on what they think is morally right, even though it contradicts with God's principles.  Ironically people cannot even live by their own principles.  They would get mad if I point that out so it's no use trying to correct them.  I simply let them fail be their own fault.  It does not matter as long as I can get a job and support my family.","I went to work.  At work I checked my email to see if I had urgent tasks.  If there are no tasks, then I would continue working on tasks that I had not finished on previous days.  I ordered some office supplies for the department.  I had lunch and took 2 breaks.  When I got home from work I did some strength exercises.  I then had dinner and went to a friend's place to hang out.  After visiting my friend I went home, brushed my teeth, had a shower, then went to bed.  I went jogging on 2 days of the past week.  Mostly it was work and hanging out with friends.  Occasionally we went out to dinner.  Twice a week I went to martial arts training.",1.0,3.6666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,1.0,1.3333333333333333,3.1666666666666665,4.0,1.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.5,1.0,1.0,3.5,5.5,2.5,16,2.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,2,42,1,English,3,5,R_1ZUhk6RvtYdsYKJ,0.03217958,-0.018736688,0.038514923,0.080401465,0.058210522,0.10133289,0.016330913,0.016521815,0.103834555,0.0025362233,0.022702064,0.08327797,0.113747396,0.18322241,0.17638665,0.056924302,0.041521072,-0.035657577,0.04359112,0.07477258,0.019721415,0.018686846,-0.04188341,-0.018480625,-0.06057643,-0.035253853,0.10216522,-0.016628886,-0.042737585,0.01746959,0.07657569,0.1400976,0.064104564,0.1393069,0.07725193,0.006644224,0.030266654,-0.029283457,-0.06330458,-0.06727278,-0.012034984,0.16591708,0.049368177,0.0015981048,0.040780935,-0.09170377,0.03993567,-0.064941056,0.07261489,0.12612703,-0.010934081,0.039801124,0.10688503,0.124323845,0.13371627,0.19647986,-0.021516984,0.089661196,0.17440462,0.14388204,0.15258795,0.0814059,0.009882078,-0.0269028,0.03132066,0.07767321,0.0422558,0.12811287,-0.0414558,-0.009481419,0.011622487,-0.079211816,0.048232388,0.008874605,0.02017212,-0.07915951,0.011311225,-0.03744565,-0.014930472,0.16227189,-0.13638233,-0.03178655,-0.1055158,-0.022318533,-0.02612321,-0.037061237,-0.13797733,0.042753097,-0.044915035,-0.018287739,-0.16318351,-0.06994344,-0.11371202,-0.07526632,-0.06444171,0.07159317,-0.069504485,-0.014474133
"For me, recently I found that one of the most important values of my life is my family. I didn't realize how important my family was to me until recently when my grandfather passed away and my grandmother moved away (rejecting the rest of her family). It made me realize how important family was to me. Not only that, but how important time also is. We are only here on this earth for a very short amount of time. We should spend every minute doing the things we love and spending time with the people we love. We aren't promised tomorrow and we should live every day like it's our last. Make sure to tell the people you love that you love them when you have the chance. Do you want to be remembered for your contributions to your work or how much you cared about those around you? These are the things that I have found to be the most important in how I live the rest of my life. I will continue to put effort into the things and people that matter most to me.","Recently, we have had our offer accepted on a house that we will move into at the end of December. The house has many renovations that need to be done. So in the past week I have been planning out many things that I want to do to the house on my phone. I have a list of things I want to accomplish after we move in. Renovation is one of my favorite things to do and I can't wait to get started renovating on the house. This has taken up a lot of my time in the past week. I can't stop thinking about all the things I want to accomplish.

"A few of my most central and important values that really stand out for me is 1: always be honest. I cannot stand being lied to, not told the whole truth because of nefarious reasons anything that is a lie i simply cannot tolerate. I even tell someone ""I do not care how bad it is please just tell me the truth and i will not get mad at you. NO matter how bad it is, no matter what and you have my word"" AND i mean it and anyone who has known me for a while and knows me for me knows that's the truth..And STILL when I know 100% without a doubt what the truth is this person will still look at me and lie right to my face. Is it post to be a significant part of my life. So i have been rather emotional about that especially lately. Battling it inside of me of what to do. I probably could've let it go once but four or five times? NO! I can't do it anymore... Honesty is what growing up the matter what just told the truth because wise always come back and make things worse. So I hold myself to a moral standard being honest. I feel betrayed and I feel like this certain person is trying to get one over on me but why would they lie if they weren't trying to hide something bigger..","My entire last seven days has not honestly been very exciting. As soon as I wake up I make a pot of coffee I get on my laptop and start trying to work on Mturk Hits just to make enough money so I can make ends meet. I start usually eight or 9 AM. I quickly take a 10 minute break in the afternoon to make a sandwich and work until nine or 10 at night. And I haven't had one day off haven't cut myself any slack at all since September. That's been my every day routine. Soon as I get off of Mturk take a shower and eventually fall asleep and start over again that's literally all I've done every day, day after day. I haven’t even been to a store in a week. So i am sorry I did my best at this writing task. I really did.",4.0,2.333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,2.5,2.833333333333333,3.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,2.5,4.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,13,2.5,4.5,3.5,1,43,1,english,1,2,R_2rSXg5q4aWcf9OZ,-0.0224891,0.04370714,0.13966796,0.1344345,0.072622985,0.15078586,-0.02255522,0.03239552,0.14352459,0.05197014,0.021028278,0.06478176,0.10508785,0.19882007,0.069370374,0.12442081,0.09224903,0.0011278391,-0.015261726,-0.024749037,-0.0011501685,-0.021093886,-0.046353634,-0.06889923,-0.013252076,0.021163769,0.13855541,-0.05883437,0.022505809,0.078458145,0.10566682,0.19694157,0.1909298,0.21045427,0.22398502,-0.030164555,0.00626429,-0.070745304,-0.081850424,-0.1202146,-0.05468173,0.3228693,0.09532906,0.11225919,0.012874708,-0.09910871,-0.0062218057,-0.01863577,0.07572839,0.18509987,-0.009161299,-0.01952353,0.16092972,0.24741729,0.071438946,0.17961058,0.04522462,0.061568912,0.24974753,0.1480901,0.08190997,0.068236075,-0.03568916,-0.031480163,0.0146706235,0.078997985,0.091115534,0.023405943,0.054762922,0.0074761994,0.08771209,-0.0006330013,0.11246729,0.07462238,0.1623353,0.05638986,0.11331785,0.022840578,0.08011956,0.12137381,-0.13707905,-0.025328731,-0.028856236,-0.0723728,0.047105655,-0.05476711,-0.059180044,0.09172994,-0.10714177,0.015937975,-0.15804604,0.0020017102,-0.10999225,-0.06789076,-0.06444019,-0.036882218,0.034897886,-0.14315051
"The most important values in my life are action over inaction and making sure I am not living life passively. For the first, I simply believe that it is one thing to hold a belief or to speak so easily about something but a more important next step is to really live those beliefs. For example, we hear a lot about being anti racist or pro environment and I know many people talk about how these beliefs are important to them but i'm more interested in how we can show these through organizing or community action or writing to local politicians about how these topics impact the community. I try to live my beliefs when I can and I know it's a huge privilege to be able to do so and not face repercussions on my job or my living situation. With work especially, diversity, equity, and inclusion are extremely important to me and I show up during meetings ready to discuss why these things are or are not happening in the spaces I take up.","Here is a list of things I did in the past week: went to sleep, cleaned my kitchen, cleaned my bathroom, watered the plants that sit in the windowsill of my living room, made my bed, brushed my teeth, brushed my hair, washed my face, applied lotion to my face, applied sunscreen to my face, put on clothes, put on shoes, walked on the sidewalk, rode on an elevator, took public transportation, went through a security line at an airport, drank a smoothie, rode on an airplane, read a book, rode in a car, decorated a Christmas tree, spent time on my laptop, showered, attended work meetings, composed and sent work emails, attended a diversity, equity, and inclusion seminar, talked to a friend about college, ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, played a video game, exercised, and spent time with family.",4.666666666666667,4.5,2.333333333333333,1.5,2.833333333333333,2.1666666666666665,3.333333333333333,2.0,4.5,5.5,5.666666666666668,3.5,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,5.5,9,3.1666666666666665,2.0,2.6666666666666665,1,27,6,English,13,6,R_Or3XbqYs1J40CoF,0.15769689,0.115827136,0.10546296,0.06530963,0.09330988,0.22537857,0.12206753,0.13161159,0.17297764,0.16562277,0.1051892,0.1483014,0.23724923,0.34373015,0.17875716,0.14095363,0.10282566,0.04515284,0.0037523508,0.017371336,0.0668431,0.12491636,-0.052438077,0.1059216,0.08516972,0.05552955,0.12584631,0.060814828,0.043598898,0.013158971,0.15191644,0.14014475,0.073582105,0.1688059,0.13079157,0.05877236,0.105245054,0.08827208,0.0017061541,0.01322801,0.053948015,0.23379797,0.08360606,0.13860284,0.18559748,0.055553086,0.13324496,0.022665212,0.212322,0.20756884,0.07986697,0.07795263,0.23776287,0.26037908,0.07755012,0.25251117,0.19349694,0.20933542,0.25645447,0.20831168,0.20862858,0.103234395,0.15884891,0.07656752,0.10092097,0.22641751,0.08949106,0.029064612,0.115128934,0.08330576,0.103823766,0.078050494,0.08600129,0.012860066,0.022818837,0.062430814,0.06903754,0.14548281,0.0899955,0.19003272,-0.10437279,-0.03536392,0.064865015,-0.078968,0.027041003,-0.027086332,0.047175948,0.2221947,0.0681627,0.08497383,-0.0755727,0.030494016,-0.017970424,0.09780763,-0.037227456,0.062325656,-0.0029162318,0.08652957
"The first is to honor God with all my heart and mind.  The second is to love your neighbor as yourself.  I think this goes beyond the ""golden rule"".  I can give to charity without expecting any return to myself except that I am making an impact. Love takes many forms.  Without love, I am nothing.","I would love to send Christmas greetings to my friends and relatives.  I did have some greeting cards, but not enough for everyone.  I usually purchase cards from UNICEF, but I do not have enough money.  I made a list of who got cards and letters, and who got just letters.  I revised the  holiday letter that I sent last year.  I checked the ink levels in my printer.
I made sure that everyone got something.

I went fishing yesterday for the first time in two years.  I enjoyed using my flyrod. My legs were to stiff to stay as long as I wanted.  I also forget clips for cutting a leader.

"My central values in life are to be comfortable and do as little harm as possible. Being comfortable is easy and, in the way I do it, makes doing less harm easier in many ways. As much as I love my work, it's not the center. My time is too precious for that, so I, and my spouse, aren't striving to be rich. I stay home a lot because that is a comfortable space. We both tend to keep to ourselves and maintain a mellow and relaxed home space. 

Reading and studying contribute to both my comfort and trying not to be a jerk. I enjoy both, but I also think that they help me to understand others better and to understand the impact of my actions better. I often encounter ideas and perspectives that I would not have found otherwise.

It's also easier not to do harm when I don't go out and around other people. I find it hard to understand what they want, and I'm definitely not the greatest at turning the other cheek. I'm not a particularly vengeful person-I won't hunt anyone down to get even or carry a grudge-but if you slap me, I'll slap you right back without thinking.

When I do get around folks, I do my best to try to recognize that they probably mean no harm. I also try to perform spontaneous acts of kindness when I can. Compliments, jokes, listening. Whatever I can think of that might put a smile on someone's face or make them feel good for a minute. 

In the end though, I'd just as soon be home with my books and spouse.","Last Saturday was unusual for me because I normally work on that day. However, I injured myself somehow and woke up in a lot of pain on that morning. As soon as it was a reasonable time of day to do so--I typically wake up between 6 and 7am, I contacted my boss. My right shoulder hurt so badly that even turning the pages of a book was unpleasant and painful. So I spent most of the day under a blanket with my arm propped up on a pillow to help stabilize it. I watched a LOT of TV since I couldn't do anything. I watched a play through of Resident Evil 2 from Leon's perspective, one episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, and then 6 episodes of Squid Game. I also very carefully stretched my arms at some point to ease the pain. I took ibuprofen throughout the day. 

Sunday, I felt better and didn't hurt, but I was carefully not to use the arm so as not to re-injure it. I studied and read most of the day. I studied both Thai and Spanish. I read from multiple books including The Portable Sixties Reader and The Blacktongue Thief. I also finished Squid Game because it was AMAZING.

Monday was another off day, and I was able to straighten up the house. As is typical of me, I studied both Thai and Spanish as well as reading through the variety of books I'm currently reading. I started a new audiobook that day, The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. I also had a hearing aid cleaning appointment that afternoon, and after that, I treated myself to a poke bowl.

Tuesday was a work day, and it was pleasant and peaceful. I saw Rida on the bus in to work that day, and there was some excitement as a man, who was being nasty and abusive to the driver, had to be thrown off the bus. All the regular riders had a good time joking and gossiping about it after he was off. I enjoy my job and the company of my coworkers, so I typically like going to work. All of our patrons were pleasant, so while it was busy, I had a good day. I brought in homemade hot cocoa mix for all of my coworkers. Tuesdays are long for me so I typically go to bed within an hour of going home. Staying up long enough only to eat, prepare my clothes for the next day, and brush my teeth. I ate ratatoille (sp?) with Italian sausage as well as black beans and rice with sweet potatoes that day.

Wednesday was great. On Wednesdays, I get to see all of my coworkers and I love that. Our boss bought us delicious pizzas and salads that day. Additionally, two patrons brought us some boxes of candy and one of our coworkers brought a tasty Chex Mix. When I got home I relaxed with a tasty hot cocoa to which I added some Dark Rum. I read and chatted with my spouse and snuggled my cat.

Thursday as usual, I cleaned the whole house. I'm off that day, and I like to get everything done in one day if possible. I washed my laundry, cleaned the bathrooms, etc. I read and studied in between rounds of housework. I worked out at some point. I sent my husband the grocery list via text, and, as is our wont, he picked up pizza on the way home and we both curled up to eat pizza and watch British comedy. We are currently watching through all of the Would I Lie to You episodes. After that, we each relaxed in our own way (he games, I read).

Today, I have done little other than study and read so far.",2.6666666666666665,2.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,1.0,1.8333333333333333,1.1666666666666667,3.333333333333333,3.0,3.0,1.5,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.5,1.0,1.5,4.0,4.0,5,2.1666666666666665,3.0,4.166666666666667,1,49,6,English,1,3,R_3xxyOPOolCWsmMV,0.05614947,0.11724518,0.12269395,0.10743038,0.09823741,0.095989674,0.035111226,0.14403301,0.11207878,0.10467053,0.09837268,0.048931517,0.10330205,0.23633873,0.16139632,0.11023292,0.14328244,0.062086158,-0.019853987,0.10637528,0.053923797,0.083116524,-0.002128805,-0.042973034,0.0069151847,-0.011003691,0.067817174,0.021043496,0.02786981,0.08021435,0.21588853,0.13396999,0.19878498,0.13657296,0.17854364,-0.04443235,0.040163048,-0.05950636,-0.04986162,-0.107563175,-0.0844957,0.17518932,0.08146093,0.059172567,0.041249074,-0.016228758,0.11172962,0.006533726,0.11126297,0.055710882,0.11213888,0.11413453,0.105034776,0.16710436,0.030458031,0.17056605,0.0040511377,0.13085282,0.26135582,0.11975044,0.18810916,0.065992296,0.16655156,0.086622275,0.19297324,0.22451417,0.20476039,0.16176555,-0.097411565,-0.057278913,0.02658173,-0.06643529,-0.0364038,-0.03547162,-0.017321952,-0.074159645,0.00612,-0.008962974,0.015107529,0.17798865,-0.15116319,-0.09160175,-0.07883041,0.04827963,-0.038889244,-0.011621894,-0.09412011,0.07753309,-0.07101078,0.10914241,-0.073141605,-0.06419814,0.06330177,-0.09159902,0.0024101455,0.024421891,0.08038637,-0.109278396
"The most important thing to me in life is honesty, I think it is important to tell people the truth. We should avoid hurting other people, just like we wouldn't want them to hurt us. Another important value is advocacy. I am forced to get a COVID vaccination even though I truly do care for my patients, i have to get something that I disagree is right for my life. I will always advocate for my patients and never, ever force them to do something they are uncomfortable with. I think it is important to have faith. Without it, the world can become even darker than it already is, and that can be scary. Faith is a very important value in my life to keep me afloat.","Over the last seven days I have...
I have worked every single day at the hospital. I have woken up at around 6 or 6:30 AM every morning. I go for a walk with my dog and then get ready for work.

"My values: when I was 16 I almost died because I was put in a hospital to find out what my health problems were. They wanted to do one weeks worth's of test but they over dosed me on something they had given me, that I was already over dosed on. So, the one thing I would have regretted was, there were people in my life, I loved and I hadn't told them. So, when I got out of the hospital I let those I loved and cared about, that I loved them. That is my main guiding principle. So, I have lived my life, with gratitude for another day, letting those I love know. 
Other core values: be true to yourself, be honest, I am dependable, hard working. Treat people with respect. I believe GOD is in every human being and to treat all people fairly, respectfully and kindly. 
Try to walk through this life, without causing or occurring any karma. 
We may not be able to control what happens in our life but we can control how we react to things. So, that is one of the reasons, I meditate. 
I feel I have lived 3 lives: my childhood were I had health problems.
I learned to control and heal those health problems through natural methods: a good organic vegan diet, exercise, yoga and meditation. Then I had my work life: were I worked for others and then had my own business which I lost in 2008 financial downturn. I did my best but the economy changed and I accepted that. Then waiting to get to receiving early social security I was almost homeless. I was lucky and fortunate that a new friend let me rent her 2nd bedroom. I only had about $700 to my name. I had to get through 3 months and found a little job that helped me make it to social security. To me at my age: my spiritual life is more important to me now. I am looking not so much to the material side of things. Peace of mind, making a connection with that creative energy in all of us, whatever you want to call it: GOD etc. 
That is more important and helping were I can.","Last Friday, got up and did my normal routine: go to the bathroom, brush my hair and tie it in a pony tail, brush teeth, shower. Drink some water, do some exercises and stretching. Then I did my morning meditation on breath and such. Then I have 1 cup of blueberries, that have thawed, which I prep before my meditation. Then I turn on my computer and look at my emails, the news, check Mechanical Turk for possible HITs. Depending on the day, I might do some chores: getting RO water filled in 3 one gallon containers. On Friday my veggies and fruits are delivered from a local organic farm. They arrived early that Friday and I put them away. I started to make my lunch around 11AM. I have been making a winter soup: onions, ginger, garlic, a potato diced, couple of celery ribs chopped, a carrot diced, some cauliflower diced, broccoli diced and a shiitake mushroom. As it continues to cook, I add spices: tumeric, basil, thyme, sage.  After about 10 minutes we add some chopped cabbage or leafy green for a few more minutes. Then we take it off the burner and add: miso, tahini and about 2-3 TBSN of nutritional yeast. To this I will add 2 heaping spoonfuls of salsa. I take my vitamins before I have my lunch. I enjoy this soup and it keeps me in good health with a strong immune system. I may tweak a bit. After lunch, I check Mechanical Turk for HITs and try to meet my daily goal.  During the afternoon, I will check what is on my to do list for that day, check Youtube, get some chores done: take out the trash, read my current book, do some tasks for my local cooperative. I think I watched a movie on Roku last Friday. I usually stop eating for the day around 4PM. So, if I am hungry, I think I had a homemade Rubin Sandwich, which I love. I make my own wheat free bread, so I grabbed a couple of slices. I put about 1/4 package of tempeh in the oven for 10 minutes on one side and then turned it over for another 5 minutes. I had the bread toasting and took that out, put mustard on it, took the tempeh out of the oven and put that on the bread. I put a couple of slices of dill pickle on it and then topped it off with my homemade purple sauerkraut. Uhmm that was good eating, done before 4PM. I checked Mechanical Turk for HITs, then did some BrainIQ excercises to stay sharp and played some online Mahjongg games on AARP website.  When the sun starts to go I do another meditation for about 20 minutes. 
After that I check for possible HITs, check Youtube again and watch Glenn Kirschner each evening for his opinion regarding Trump's investigations etc.
I usually get some evening news items via my email, from people I trust for accurate news. Will watch some fun youtube videos till I start to get tired, which is around 9PM. Do one last meditation before I go to bed.
I have given you a pretty good idea what I did last Friday. My routine varies a little but that is about it.",4.166666666666667,3.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,2.0,3.1666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,5.0,2.5,5.666666666666668,3.0,5.5,2.5,5.5,3.5,2.5,5.0,22,3.1666666666666665,2.0,3.1666666666666665,1,69,7,English,1,3,R_3dPOSVEEJNa43C4,0.06282159,0.10001016,0.07240013,0.027764255,0.12220742,0.1293622,0.017782263,0.10668185,0.0976541,0.20218505,0.011799613,0.059997108,0.16430673,0.2553143,0.103076056,0.11423228,0.09491241,0.04382763,-0.04664321,-0.0098221535,0.038399912,-0.028351001,-0.062004905,0.010237325,0.05627642,0.06074272,0.090470344,0.030784998,0.037192356,0.052916043,0.16982293,0.13478595,0.1703301,0.15604335,0.15783389,0.018407,0.07694687,0.029324122,-0.0025339476,-0.021885972,0.011826449,0.20526335,0.043533195,-0.0063029416,0.08563672,-0.043667063,0.050815973,0.0712041,0.0737059,0.07960957,0.020556832,0.05246695,0.11120589,0.03936207,0.112987936,0.16687497,0.09684807,0.12133301,0.25608262,0.07711256,0.12279229,0.053750858,0.008745294,0.017540958,0.011676952,0.021541396,0.14518097,0.10154724,-0.041387603,-0.02553468,0.059617214,-0.04784365,0.07397474,-0.005712375,0.0060188873,0.02314359,0.068943486,0.011033225,0.061924063,0.08241539,-0.09888929,-0.02719383,-0.0078329425,0.030836683,-0.010042186,-0.12533563,0.01806414,0.14700836,0.016953152,0.052072734,-0.046156004,-0.0036629103,0.0019140597,0.013097119,0.022830946,-0.0005658418,0.10499799,-0.04792171
"I wish that I could say that I have completely pulled myself through this period of not knowing who I am, however in contrast, the struggle to regain solid ground has been all uphill and the burden of feeling lost in my world became magnified, more confused, and a period of testing that I am not even sure how I survived this time, except by the grace of God and the support of my daughters and friends. I am confident, however, that these trials that I have been going through are going to work out for the good, eventually.","A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.

"I think that in one sense, the most important value that guides my life is objectivity. The more I experience life, the more I seek to understand what is actually happening. What happens, happens. Objective reality doesn't depend on my mind to conceive it or to understand it. It just is. Admittedly, this value leads me to a place some would find ironic. It leads me to meditate often on Christianity, not as a political movement or a particular sect, although to be sure as a human person I count myself among a group of people who are, or seek, or claim to be like-minded. Rather, I meditate on Christianity as being the desire to imitate Christ. One of my favorite writers and opinion journalists typically writes about politics, but he occasionally has fascinating insights into faith. He has written about the need for Christians to understand that we believe audacious, implausible, radical things. That is undoubtedly true. But if I believe what I believe, I do it because I believe that Christ is the Nexus between humanity and the Divine. He is ultimate reality. His simultaneous humanity and Divinity simply are, whether I believe that or can understand it.","Last Friday I did some laundry, sent an email to my boss, and went to the gym. I had lunch and packed a duffel bag, said goodbye to my wife and began to drive to Fort Worth to see my father. On the way to Fort Worth I stopped to get a haircut and buy a beer. I had another drink upon arriving in Fort Worth then went to my father's house. I spent the night and on Saturday morning I went to a gym there so see several friends. I spent the afternoon sitting and talking with my father, watching golf on TV. Then I checked into a hotel and got ready to go to a friend's birthday party. I met my friends for the birthday dinner and had ceviche and tacos. We had a few drinks and then went dancing. I had a lot of fun. I went back to the hotel and fell asleep watching TV. On Sunday I went to the gym and took a kickboxing class. I went to lunch and had a chicken sandwich and some beer. I talked to the bartender about her perfume and how it smells almost indistinguishable from a much more expensive perfume that another friend of mine wears. Both perfumes are tenacious, almost obnoxious and have become very popular, so I smell them seemingly all the time. I drove back home and had dinner with my wife. I played with our new dog. On Monday I woke up and drove to pick up a different dog that belongs to a friend because I'd be pet sitting the dog while my friend and her husband returned from a vacation in Mexico. I answered a call from my wife and had a conversation about a thankfully minor car accident that she was in that afternoon. I sat and wondered how we were going to fit the car repairs into our budget. That night I met a friend at a concert. We talked about our wives and how they seem to never want to come out with us. On Tuesday I worked from home, then went to the gym, then got home and worked some more. On Wednesday I spent most of the morning at the gym until I returned home. I worked hard at my regular job and occasionally did some Mturk work when I needed a break. Yesterday morning I went to the gym and taught my kickboxing class. I met my wife at her office for their Christmas party. I had some barbecue then went home and started working to finish an important project for work. I worked almost all night before going to bed just before dawn.",4.833333333333333,1.1666666666666667,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.5,3.0,5.333333333333333,3.5,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.5,23,3.5,6.0,3.6666666666666665,2,46,1,English,6,6,R_1GCFMFWvRJpnjjU,0.09611892,0.009493977,0.11161866,0.056067467,0.046660285,0.20056684,-0.018265598,0.08349174,0.07933017,0.06481442,-0.049171302,-0.0946002,0.02592159,0.065902665,0.12805462,0.08286412,0.09249288,0.03983282,-0.08846502,0.0049484484,0.0556522,-0.02065463,0.032457694,0.0850508,0.05396855,-0.017944802,0.10479441,0.0998087,0.025644127,-0.036248114,0.02908012,0.12351426,0.062441204,-0.050663464,-0.05533791,0.009958293,-0.025050662,0.04512584,-0.06481085,0.0551531,-0.059748136,0.117697105,0.07906383,0.014959631,0.11486853,-0.13280511,0.05309685,-0.060666636,0.061615266,0.04631046,-0.008159661,-0.058912896,0.18661949,-0.045825347,0.08671722,0.09311661,0.13057655,0.19070944,0.13893351,0.09013939,0.025192942,0.062706694,-0.014525086,0.0073093325,-0.05503836,0.073375255,0.07990163,0.07976722,0.025718682,-0.09529422,0.025133464,-0.021004893,0.06219783,0.111295536,0.032412227,-0.041150186,-0.00204093,0.04047,-0.010747887,0.10086674,-0.14255981,-0.025461957,-0.071192525,-0.024363931,-0.021628285,0.066895664,-0.006218992,0.06674351,0.115758836,0.045179345,-0.092097044,-0.08694866,-0.050859436,0.055384856,0.023899097,0.17620295,0.0040801996,0.0026058555
"The biggest value that I think helps guide my life is trying to always do what is right, not was is the easiest or most comfortable.

"My basic values and guiding principles are honesty and communication. I hold a lot of value in my words as well as other's words. Another value is the trust that I hold in people.  I greatly value being compassionate and considerate of others and hold old values that my parents taught me.   I try to incorporate my values into all dealings with people I know from my wife to my friends to my acquaintances.  When dealing with a difficult situation, I look inside myself to imagine how it will affect all including myself. I look at my personal truth and ask myself if I will cause anyone pain or possible short- or long-term effects.","I do many things every day including getting up, walking, feeding the animals, making coffee and breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I sit down at the computer and check emails and work daily remotely for a few hours as I do marketing for a real estate group.
Some of the special things that I have done over the past week includes:
Last Friday, I drove to Arizona with my best friend and visited my brother and his wife. I had not seen them since January 2020, so it was a very nice experience.  We ate out and talked and laughed, decorating their tree! 
My best friend's birthday was Saturday, so we took her to a nice restaurant and had a wonderful birthday dinner.  We spent time talking, laughing and sharing many stories as we had not spent time together for over a year since the pandemic started.
My friends and I watched football on Sunday all day, which is one of the biggest activities I do on Sundays!  I played my fantasy football teams and didn't win but had a wonderful time doing it.   We barbequed steak and chicken for dinner, as well as for snacks during the week.
On Monday, my wife and I went out to breakfast with our nextdoor neighbors. We went to a restaurant at a golf course; it was relaxing and very scenic with the course and mountains. Later in the day, I took one of my cats for a checkup at the vet.  She is doing well!
I haven't done any other special things the rest of the week except for taking a walk in the evenings after dinner and then going to bed tired each evening!

The most important value I hold is honesty. I value honesty above all else. I believe practicing honesty and transparency is what bonds people together and creates a strong foundation for a lifelong relationship. Tied into that is reliability- being able to rely on someone to be honest with you and be there for you in your darkest moments.,"Early in the week I spent several hours cooking and preparing meals that my husband and I would eat throughout the work-week. I made loaded potato soup, vegetarian stir fry, and thee-cheese lasagna. Mid-week I had begun to clean the house in the evenings after work in preparation for guests during the holidays. In between those activities I've also been giving daily care to my dogs and chickens. That includes feeding, watering, cleaning bedding, etc.",4.833333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.5,3.0,3.1666666666666665,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,5.0,2.5,5.0,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,5.0,5,3.0,3.0,4.166666666666667,1,27,6,English,1,5,R_WpTJ6ULBnySnAdj,0.04144767,0.12225243,0.1199023,0.043689676,0.023263115,0.19634065,0.07436311,0.06300739,0.08689043,0.15733683,-0.04700184,0.07723717,0.26287422,0.3641448,0.11784671,0.07755512,0.07603101,0.0751862,-0.07184227,0.037464254,0.07943137,0.07871702,0.04580838,0.16092038,0.064846225,0.12442446,0.114010006,0.13976161,0.0038581677,0.0241368,0.20870006,0.06726986,0.027781416,0.18947083,0.13574927,-0.0006629161,0.04910423,0.082385994,-0.043192584,-0.03428355,0.0385174,0.20220819,0.087080754,0.08599177,0.14519998,0.04682152,-0.0022159684,0.10136263,0.110328615,0.1504606,0.09485715,0.11630516,0.10814649,0.13590568,0.0710433,0.2297506,0.07184923,0.15059781,0.26834598,0.19189388,0.18987352,0.09614797,0.10761602,0.05687173,0.04519552,0.070541784,0.047782384,0.075219706,-0.015651997,0.041984066,0.10439636,-0.018452857,0.08046591,-0.04052255,0.03373308,0.015466332,0.09359794,-0.027829751,0.046924464,0.12959479,-0.06722462,-0.10238385,0.0046625063,-0.018201305,-0.09567914,-0.09325306,0.02091571,0.1897267,0.0461258,0.07962318,-0.009853004,-0.04801715,0.07685889,0.07131457,-0.0153830275,0.026547175,0.018874042,0.056061164
"The central value that guides my life is my belief in Jesus and following His teachings and virtues. I think that guides my behavior at work, my choice in marriage partner, the way I raise my children, even interactions and choices with friends. For the most part it's just consistent with living a moral life respectful of others, but every now and then I am aware of how different it might be from others approaches. For instance, I have a very diverse group of friends, my two closest friends are Muslim and Jewish respectively; they recently invited me to a movie with them but I declined. I stated that it wasn't my thing, but the reality is that it was not to my taste because I believe in only presenting to my eyes and ears subjects that promote my values, not degrading/immoral/trashy/scary things that promote the devil's work. I do not wish to offend and I pass no judgement on those who do not find it to be so; good for them for resisting that way. I know myself and don't want to let the devil in, I'm not strong enough, so I avoid it.","In the last week I have done many things. It's the holiday season, so yes we are doing our every day activities of going to work, exercising, reading, and eating dinner as a family, but we are also doing some special activities. We went to see the Nutcracker at the local theatre, and ""Elf"" the musical in a touring group. We went to our church's holiday themed ""Family Night"" and had dinner, read a story, made crafts, and had treats. We went to tour the ""largest Christmas attraction"" in Texas, Santa's Wonderland, on Sunday. It was very fun but very crowded and the cost was basically a car payment. It can't be a yearly thing but it was nice for this year. And last night we went and toured a local tree farm's light displays. Today we have plans to see the Polar Express at a local restaurant where they are doing a kids night with cocoa and other treats.",4.833333333333333,2.1666666666666665,4.0,2.5,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.0,4.666666666666667,6.0,3.0,5.666666666666668,3.5,5.5,3.5,5.5,5.5,2.5,6.0,27,3.1666666666666665,2.5,3.6666666666666665,1,31,1,English,6,5,R_2EzsDxhm0iJmzSq,0.03693653,0.062668905,0.14115104,0.022125686,0.09001068,0.26722068,0.08333925,0.19617653,0.1870212,0.20676884,-0.0024174303,0.18161431,0.31120765,0.34119684,0.13218741,0.09464964,0.06717103,-0.0010440983,0.016959602,0.014026474,0.083425,0.094094135,-0.015909752,0.08025418,0.11564482,0.09983142,0.21462204,0.10320561,0.0020850599,0.02359766,0.09483242,0.20242146,0.12575674,0.16445318,0.07044265,-0.012161931,0.079105586,0.043534607,-0.053690683,-0.011175264,-0.036613524,0.24769692,0.06829697,0.09992248,0.071875826,-0.043005526,0.053086832,0.09752599,0.14090835,0.107287854,0.11411329,0.06613878,0.32904345,0.3357438,0.14006427,0.09896043,0.13820076,0.14625749,0.23585677,0.17353672,0.14790569,0.018351851,-0.0007449724,-0.039975792,0.03418954,0.046761535,0.075923175,0.046935603,0.10922134,0.06795272,0.09311397,0.1313368,0.10487685,0.037265025,0.03079922,0.05707661,0.05738408,0.06702424,-0.01824521,0.002151562,-0.11288071,-0.07187235,0.11065803,-0.065599285,0.06580298,-0.045669414,0.072245464,0.25651202,0.0120140165,0.06303914,0.002136292,-0.061872303,0.060163625,-0.0103584025,-0.08514081,0.096413486,0.013571281,-0.04833132

The most important thing in my life is my children.  Being a mother is very important to me because they rely on me to take care of them and I have a responsibility to them.  I love them very much so I take this responsibility seriously.  Giving them a good life by providing for them but also by giving them love and spending time with them is what guides my decisions.  I always have their best interest in mind. I try to improve my life circumstances so they can have a happy life.,"In the past week, on a typical day, I wake up around 6 am and have coffee. My daughters watch cartoons while we get dressed, I drop them off at day care close to 8am then I go to work.  For lunch, I usually go home to eat or do some quick chores.  After work, I pick my daughters up around 5pm.  We eat dinner, shower and watch tv until bed time.  After my children are asleep, I enjoy some time to myself to eat dessert and watch tik tok videos.  Sometimes I also do yoga or watch TV.  Today is a little different since my children are with their father for the weekend so I will probably pick up dinner after work and then go home.",3.1666666666666665,4.0,3.8333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,2.333333333333333,2.5,3.5,3.1666666666666665,5.5,2.5,5.666666666666668,3.0,5.0,5.5,6.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,19,2.0,2.0,3.8333333333333335,1,35,1,English,6,3,R_1IdemGN9Abna493,0.0638104,0.114884,0.24962665,0.15795888,0.06583758,0.18122059,0.10352052,0.049700163,0.15945974,0.14759159,0.019611375,0.059301965,0.23693675,0.3698582,0.1094988,0.11065863,0.044781163,0.010455372,-0.091921,0.043288868,0.06336282,0.022870526,0.02325718,0.12745398,0.05136678,0.07914387,0.08234249,0.10756658,0.04556703,0.03224811,0.18746156,0.1691891,0.09688281,0.19655816,0.13480528,0.036104664,0.024248634,0.106545635,0.005246793,-0.017566392,0.054133505,0.2567403,0.2140015,0.12828404,0.089469686,0.038380843,0.050311185,0.09066667,0.13145447,0.1419634,0.08132413,0.040901564,0.10811777,0.23483413,0.14467849,0.2236687,0.10162199,0.1918425,0.33909762,0.20928027,0.20457895,0.1483564,-0.060878858,-0.02772524,0.0016387608,0.019766327,0.026873771,0.04244577,0.030641101,0.027519478,0.123502694,0.06956421,0.04844874,0.035415016,0.069934726,0.05407636,0.01747637,0.0014903396,0.07236828,0.16021423,0.098708004,-0.056484308,-0.005259577,0.017166518,-0.0072204676,-0.06904611,0.059117407,0.1895796,0.15992439,0.03218692,0.07027121,0.01451505,-0.008864947,-0.01456403,-0.0817168,0.021142667,-0.029651897,0.041833974
"A huge guiding factor in my life is if something will benefit or hurt me based on my actions or the decisions I make. Before I do or decide anything, I really take a step back and evaluate what it is that I am trying to accomplish. If its going to be beneficial in any way, I go ahead and decide for it. However, I also look into the future possible outcome of said decision. Its like a Yes or No algorithm scheme. I run through the scenarios that a decision might lead to, then what that will lead  to, and so on. This to me feels like the safest route. I do sometimes go with the flow, but I more likely than not think about my actions before I do them. I don't do it slowly either. I am able to process and internalize what is going on and fully understand what I want and want to accomplish.","On Sunday I start my week. Its my Brazilian jiu-jitsu training day, and after I really feel like I am reborn. The sport is something I took up 3 years ago and I feel amazing for taking it up. Once I finish my training, I take a shower and get on my computer for the rest of the night. I play World of Warcraft daily and have scheduled raids with other people throughout the week. In these raids, the other 19 people and I get together and we focus on obtaining a common goal of defeating a hard boss/monster. This happens several times throughout the week. During the week in between raiding, I work online and go to school online. ITs simple enough that I can get it done without any problems. I also workout at the gym nearby.",2.833333333333333,3.1666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,2.833333333333333,3.1666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,5.5,5.5,5.0,6.0,5.5,5.0,5.5,5.0,5.5,3.5,5,3.1666666666666665,2.0,4.5,1,31,6,english,16,5,R_2y2URL0cOygpOJW,-0.0041281357,0.079949185,0.20621914,0.19878466,0.16706935,0.12579526,0.022450635,0.068180844,0.16483697,0.09783931,0.09698716,0.16972186,0.19578913,0.24632674,0.10720557,0.1131302,0.19081126,0.007606918,-0.015501183,0.11955953,0.079466216,-0.012524914,0.028287392,0.013560433,-0.017559106,-0.09227823,0.09358054,0.023976859,0.050231576,0.04795101,0.18832578,0.24670316,0.24625319,0.1447537,0.13407665,0.0022694822,0.048092887,0.0035094544,0.0073622074,-0.04274195,-0.03477815,0.20230386,0.08872181,0.09196408,0.12238089,0.006227025,0.06921172,-0.022624174,0.19742888,0.1842452,0.08802877,0.021553366,0.08574927,0.21964657,0.21419458,0.20221227,0.08103436,0.16433533,0.23225555,0.13004297,0.1120764,0.145128,0.02100184,-0.018677603,0.019038847,0.016717069,0.07151512,0.08692161,0.055414543,-0.03182855,0.080067515,0.03166158,0.16213849,0.04952071,0.049536142,0.045746885,0.048764676,0.053169094,0.05984978,0.1906034,-0.05943682,-0.021730458,0.028702294,0.08999863,0.121734396,0.068556264,-0.05247897,0.08672171,-0.0057926234,0.14189595,-0.008963028,0.09767799,0.040173195,-0.057129726,-0.0087237805,0.0068803923,-0.011600409,-0.027822545

"I ask myself if the things I'm doing are healthy for both my mind and body. I want to be completely transparent with myself and those close to me because it's what I want from them. If I'm not honest with myself, how can I be honest with someone else? I want to be responsible and reliable in my everyday actions because, if I can't count on myself to do the right thing for myself and others, I would not be happy in my own skin. I need to trust both my action and their consequences. So, at the end of the day, I am happy with the person I am--my moral and conscious decision-making skills.","During the past 7 days, because of Covid-19, my partner and I have spent time by ourselves. We greet the day with a special brew of coffee and talk about the day, as we watch the bunnies, birds, and squirrels munch on the food we put out in our backyard. After sitting, and watching the day start, we separate and go about our own tasks. I have done editing on my book of short stories, while he is either watching YouTube or fixing a household appliance. We then took a nice walk through the desert as it's warm enough to enjoy the wonderful views and sky! After our walk, we will again separate, and I worked on emails and communicating with my friends on Social Media. I did that for about an hour each day. Finally, we prepared our dinner meal together, with soft jazz playing in the background.

"One day, a man who I knew quite well, stopped me outside the library and told me that I was the MOST serious person he knew. I really didn't question him about his opinion of me, but I've spent considerable time over the last 15 years since that incident. 
I consider myself a pretty jovial person and light hearted but there what it made me do is look at those issues that I take VERY seriously.
Of those are, the treatment of those who are disadvantaged, whether it's related to race, gender identification, child/spousal abuse as well as other discriminatory practices.
I know that I can be very passionate when it come to child abuse and have started groups that discuss abuse and what we as a community can to do recognize it and to take action to keep if from happening. 
More recently with the killing of George Floyd and the BLM movement I have attended protests on the streets and have spent considerable amount of time bringing up issues/incidents on my Facebook page, and quite often stepping back and watching to see how others interact and often watching things turn into very heated debates. I often try to stay out of it, but at times almost have to step in as a referee. 
I tend to side with the ecology movement especially as it relates to our forests and oceans, and of climate change. Even though I'm of very simple means, I will take and contribute money to such organizations such as Green Peace and the Audubon Society. Being someone that is very at home in the out-of-doors in all four seasons, preservation of our environment is essential. 
I could go on..but I'll leave it at that.","For the past month, I have been living in an RV traveling along the west coast to where I currently am, in Tucson Arizona. I have typically start my day out reading email, posting to and replying to Facebook, and of course doing surveys on Mturk. 
During the day, either going shopping or going on hikes with our Golden Doodle or doing maintenance on the RV. 
Evenings are usually spent watching a show or two on the Discovery Channel. 
I think the most enjoyable thing we did was visit a very touristy community south of us, where my partner and I did some shopping and had a nice leisurely lunch.
At 67 life isn't quite as exciting as it was when I was younger, but I think I take just as much enjoyment in the smaller things in life.",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.166666666666667,2.1666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,5.0,5.5,14,3.5,2.0,3.6666666666666665,2,67,6,English,1,5,R_2ZV33jDg4e8Glgn,0.114704326,0.1721267,0.2654872,0.21563394,0.115221426,0.36826256,0.13979569,0.14483461,0.26005062,0.16393271,0.09599067,0.20214473,0.2440232,0.3457796,0.19745508,0.212637,0.16684125,0.031732,0.02115812,0.06535299,0.113031425,0.0689329,0.06381443,0.13586272,0.14655638,0.021433558,0.20775947,0.055223957,0.09124389,0.038115256,0.18976812,0.28486693,0.20126487,0.2077596,0.19168507,0.10584217,0.09732844,0.12579627,0.12152447,0.028274622,0.085633524,0.27795053,0.26880133,0.19408102,0.11250385,-0.010198504,0.11106118,0.20156236,0.234016,0.24044539,0.27703834,0.1261664,0.25248414,0.5261051,0.1482378,0.17042689,0.1589651,0.25367764,0.24747747,0.29777047,0.23466468,0.14947052,0.13333905,0.07361984,0.036369197,0.17646341,0.048835814,0.0847905,0.102669045,0.11077429,0.14825758,0.13114655,0.07488892,0.04168818,0.07467131,0.038837552,-0.0118899625,0.1516982,0.09256159,0.14262253,-0.02939141,-0.030138578,0.17083098,-0.076595515,0.06865317,0.015569981,0.1277664,0.24944574,0.075953946,0.1954707,0.0069236,0.045820564,-0.0094342865,0.12942159,-0.098623246,0.21301013,-0.013425786,0.12704858
"Really all my values boil down to ""be kind"".  As long as I am kind to others and do what I can to help out and show that I care to all of my friends then I feel that I have done my duty both as a human and as a friend.  There is no sense in being unkind to anyone no matter how you feel about their life choices.  Just be kind.  Everyone is equally human and no one can control what race/ gender/ sexual orientation they are born as.  So why waste any time being intentionally mean?  I mean sure I've had days where I have been less than.  I always go back and apologize and make up for my wrong doings and move on with those people I was unkind to.  I have a very good friend who I met online and he just came out as identifying as transgender and would prefer for everyone to refer to them as he/them.  So of course I agree and don't change the way I treat this friend.  Because even though I am referring to this friend as he now instead of she.  They are sill the same person who I knew before and as I stated before is a human deserving of kindness.","In the past week I have not done very much.  I get up each morning around 10 AM and make my coffee and feed my cat.  Then I head back upstairs after saying good morning to my husband and start work for the day.  I work part time as an office manager for my Dad's business.  After I do my work for the day I head back downstairs to clean up the house a little bit.  This week though since Christmas is soon I've been making cookies and candies.  I've been thinking about trying to start a candy making business and sell candies either online or at fairs.  When I'm done for the day making cookies and candies this week I will usually sit in the living room and talk with my husband while he finishes up his day at work and play a game either on my phone or on our PS4.  I'll start making dinner after he is done at work, we'll eat together and then he goes to bed around 8 or 9 PM.  I then will go over to my computer room and play video games until about 3 AM.",2.1666666666666665,1.1666666666666667,4.166666666666667,1.5,2.0,1.3333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.5,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,5.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,6.0,5.5,5,2.6666666666666665,3.5,4.333333333333333,1,28,6,English,1,3,R_2fktLMI1PTuVVXC,-0.05892226,-0.05066611,0.13771531,0.058009844,-0.032504193,0.19389313,-0.08237374,-0.021913476,0.030892096,0.070798464,-0.09685065,0.053054906,0.088846356,0.15955758,-0.0062411623,0.024587411,0.021070745,-0.008117275,-0.049274128,-0.08063441,-0.0133347055,0.020040665,-0.010018315,0.12147555,0.08431578,0.041716088,0.27123404,-0.0011196891,-0.08671402,0.012420083,0.069518104,0.18671715,0.13058975,0.090411566,0.08036345,-0.045712586,0.041994493,0.022717658,-0.07650919,-0.047811456,-0.057879884,0.23610319,0.06319902,0.0969292,0.053235915,-0.060270622,-0.057354454,0.015112694,0.04394989,0.13295393,-0.041725576,-0.06946354,0.17761934,0.221352,0.14862603,0.117966294,0.052364726,0.08939564,0.23134615,0.14153594,0.12398105,0.03265074,-0.073992446,-0.07064882,-0.09522283,-0.095562905,-0.05812239,0.006498255,0.08366008,0.030521326,0.054909497,0.06397198,0.08477196,0.04221496,0.14585823,0.041978024,0.045309555,-0.08553806,0.044276416,0.06935831,-0.111411616,-0.1325773,-0.05477706,-0.11250978,-0.036211934,-0.09959589,-0.004715301,0.087298326,0.001545582,0.007229928,-0.024452435,-0.010792042,-0.092186764,-0.0016026013,-0.116827995,0.0120828,0.020097215,-0.08356887
"My central guiding values deride from Jesus Christ and my relationship with Him. As God incarnate, Jesus came to Earth to show the world what God the Father is truly like. The depth of His love compelled Him to sacrifice His life on the cross in order to atone for the sins of the world. That compels me to obey Him when He asks me to have compassion for others and tell them of God's love for them and the salvation available to them in Jesus. It also compels me to give charitably to those in need. The love of Christ plays the central role in all my decision-making; it forces me to consider and then act on what is best for me, for others, and for society in terms of furthering the Kingdom of God, since this world in temporal, and the Kingdom of God is eternal. Therefore, my over-arching goal is to persuade as many people as possible to accept Jesus as Savior and Lord and therefore become citizens of Heaven, and saved from eternity in Hell.","Last Saturday I got up relatively early in the morning (as I do everyday), I went for a walk and prayed. I came home and read the Bible. Then I watched Tucker Carlson's program from the night before on the Fox News channel website. After that I had breakfast. I then read some from a novel (Quichotte by Salman Rusdie). In the early evening I went to church, came home and had dinner. I read some more from the novel and watched some videos on YouTube.

"My deepest held value is innovation for a better future. This would be overshadowed in most countries by organized religion. As a result, those countries that have only that option fall behind the more advanced nations. What I have found is that all of those countries with the largest religions tend to also have advanced tech, so I hold innovation and the pursuit of it as a guiding principle in my life.","For the past seven days, I have walked to places where I can work online, gone to stores, and done yard work. The yard work was mostly raking leaves. Groceries were bought at the stores, and the online work was contract research and development for colleges and businesses. I enjoy the work, but the pay leaves much to be desired. That was two or three hours each day. I walked to the uplink locations, chosen for their proximity to the stores I shopped at.

"I have a few important values that guide my life. I believe honesty is the best value anyone can have. No matter the situation, if you are honest it will be better than if you were to lie. Lying causes you to be caught up in different webs that you cannot get through once you create so many of them. I also believe in never judging anything by its cover. This applies to both people and aspects. I have had many relationships that have turned out amazing with people I would have never expected to like because of their cover. I have also had ideas instilled in me that I would have previously rejected if I had not dug deeper than the cover.","Beginning a week ago, I got up in the morning like usual to wake my son up for school. He gets up and I help him get dressed and brush his teeth before he gets on the bus. Once he is on the bus I let my dogs out to use the bathroom and get started on making my coffee. I usually log into my computer after this and turn on the TV. I watch morning talk shows while I do my work. Around 2pm my son gets home from school. I help him do his homework and then begin battling laundry, dishes, and vacuuming before my husband gets home at 6pm. I cook dinner so that it is done by 7pm and after we eat whoever needs a shower takes one. By 8:30pm it is bedtime for everyone in the house.

"The central value that guides my life is helping myself and others better themselves. Every decision I make is guided by if it is making me or someone else better in some capacity. This is not always easy. At times you need to be the ""bad guy"" to help others reach their goals and get better at something. Sometimes you personally need to do things that you don't want to but you know it will help you in the long run. At the end of the day are we progressing as a society or myself as a human is always the question that guides my decisions. Am I helping my coworkers and clients get better everyday? Am I having an impact on other people's lives in a positive way? If I am doing that am I bettering my own life?","Last Friday I trained women's lacrosse and softball. I also trained myself and maxed out on upper body lifts. It was my mother's birthday so I had her and my family over for some appetizers and drinks. We played some games and then we went to a very nice fancy dinner. The next day I was very tired. I woke up and fed all of the pets. I went over to my parents house to help them put the tree up. I worked on my girlfriend's christmas present before coming back home to feed the pets dinner. The following day I fed the pets again. Then I went to the grocery store and did meal prep for the week. I also went to the gym. I then went to subway for dinner and picked my girlfriend up from the airport. We came home, fed the pets and went to bed. I went to work the following morning for open hours from 9-3pm. I worked out and then came home and spent time with my girlfriend. The next day I had the same work schedule and basically the exact same day. Wednesday I went to work. After that I interviewed for a new personal training part time job. Then I took my girlfriend to the bike shop to get her bike fixed. We stopped for food and then went to a friend christmas party. The following day I had work again and right after work went to a work bowling party.

"The values that guide my life are honesty, integrity, loyalty, and hard work. I feel like you have to be true to yourself and represent yourself honestly to others. This is the only way to find true acceptance and invite true acceptance into your life, to ultimately establish the kinds of relationships and find the kind of success (however that is defined) in life.  Treat others only as you want to be treated and expect nothing else. Hold yourself to high standards and don't compare yourself to others, which includes having expectations. Do if for yourself. Find true relationships and hold onto them and work to keep them. Understand what it means to be a real friend and know that the payoff is not superficial, but it is beyond that. Never act expecting returns.","7 days ago, I started my day waking up and driving my son to daycare. I returned home and worked a full day, which included doing various tasks at my computer, attending meetings, writing emails, etc. After work, I picked my son up from daycare. We came home and made dinner and played togehter and read, before getting ready for bed. We then went to sleep. The next day, we woke up and went grocery shopping. We then spent the afternoon playing at the park. At home, I made lunch for us and we hung out at home. We went out to dinner with some friends later before returning home and getting ready for bed (bath time and reading) and went to bed. The next day, we ran errands together, and then played at home together most of the day. The next day, I started our work week routine again. Woke up, drove my son to daycare, then returned home to start my work day. I participated in various work activities which includes meetings, emails, etc. I also met a friend for lunch this day. I picked up my son from daycare at the end of the day, and then I made dinner for us and we read and played together before going to bed. The next three days were the same routine. We woke up, I drove my son to daycare, and I worked at home. My work days were mostly the same, with the exception of one day we had a holiday get together for a few hours at a coworkers house. It was a potluck. Other than that, I picked up my son as usual, we played together and ate dinner together, and then went to bed. We watched TV one or two nights for a couple of hours in the evening.",2.0,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.0,1.1666666666666667,4.166666666666667,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,5,3.333333333333333,3.5,3.0,1,38,6,English,1,6,R_2EaY0VBn9HLCuwh,0.03727699,-0.07096474,0.13223535,0.041414127,-0.006069762,0.08116412,0.01903142,0.03449837,0.11844905,0.04825457,-0.093999565,0.040246002,0.058426708,0.14610463,0.049162004,0.037067484,-0.001139652,-0.022079624,-0.07294311,-0.014320224,-0.03559767,-0.023551676,-0.033056967,0.029611148,-0.018528583,0.0079233255,0.07890836,0.088094346,-0.026190594,-0.023848567,0.047766395,0.17840329,0.04847298,0.037527733,0.070190236,-0.119958885,-0.033424474,-0.01859126,-0.12203779,-0.06767452,-0.12499803,0.21789896,0.06019783,-0.068590306,0.02474485,-0.13062477,-0.047002256,-0.037694015,-0.02197595,0.07957802,-0.04609856,-0.06755489,0.06416717,0.13384022,0.056114614,0.0957423,-0.05554711,-0.014355311,0.16965349,0.06293063,0.010476965,0.07920261,-0.07916705,-0.088400826,-0.11853486,-0.06290369,-0.0920266,-0.02191201,-0.017132172,-0.086160615,-0.0031220391,-0.078012936,0.09988761,-0.1003744,-0.046755634,-0.037295166,-0.054662906,-0.07639018,-0.049528044,0.049360357,-0.0030475166,-0.14632179,-0.06608281,-0.10236653,-0.05152596,-0.0031579994,-0.106681034,0.022746485,0.053501647,-0.070325166,-0.008387356,-0.058909915,-0.15800399,-0.0547357,-0.13158435,-0.018317241,-0.15615584,-0.03701409
"At this stage of my life, my values are centered on the Catholic Church and the Bible.  The top commandments are love of God and neighbor. So I try to do on to others as I'd have them do onto me.  That is respect their space and possessions, deal honestly with them, give when possible, try to be courteous in all events and pray for them whether I actually like them or not.  As Catholics we try to stay from sin as best we can.  Also, we are to be good stewards of what God has given us, so that means trying to take care of the planet and be as environmentally friendly as possible.  Also, I eat organic food which leaves far less of an imprint than conventional food does.","Last Friday, I got up had warm lemon water and read the Magnificat., worked, made/ate lentil burgers and salad.  I worked some more than I did deadlifts, Bulgarian squats and rows.  I ate dinner and watched tv including Jeopardy.  I cleaned the kitchen, did some more emails, read the back of the Magnificat, showered went to bed.  Saturday, I drank lemon water and read the Magnificat.  I cleaned/vacuumed the house, ate, went to Mass and came back home to exercise.  I said some prayers then ate dinner, watched Perry Mason, cleaned the kitchen, read the end of the Magnificat, showered and went to bed.  Sunday, I got up, drank lemon water and read the Magnificat.  Played an online NFL pick'em game, walked for 2 miles and came home and ate.  I played a few more NFL games, watched some NFL games, watched Power of the Dog and did some more prayers.  I ate dinner, cleaned the kitchen, did some more prayers and went to bed.

"My most important values in life are knowledge acquisition, hard work, and providing for my children. I also value things like honesty and helping others, but they are not guiding principles in my life. I am here to provide for my family and my children, not other people. It is not my job to take care of people who are less fortunate. I have been in the workforce since the age of 17 (13 if you count my newspaper delivery job when I was a kid), so I believe that hard work will get you where you need to go. I was raised with two mentally ill parents in a subsidized neighborhood, and my parents did not have much money. I made myself into what I am today, and because of that, I am entitled to what I have earned through my education and hard work. I am only obligated to share my accomplishments with my own family.","Last Friday I woke up and took the kids to school in the morning. Then I came to work. Last week I finished my SWOT analysis research paper and presentation for my public affairs class. I turned it in Sunday. Over the weekend I got caught up on housework. I played Guess Who with my son. Monday through Friday of the current week I went to work as normal, nothing out of the ordinary occurred. My son got suspended from the school bus Wednesday, and that was frustrating because my husband had to pick him up from work. He was grounded for his bad behavior. I am out of college until January 10, so I have been playing Dragon Mania Legends, a game my husband and I enjoy. I have also been completing mTurk surveys to earn some extra money in my down time until my classes resume in January. Throughout the week I also eat dinner with my family each night. I have also been wrapping Christmas presents and putting them under the tree. In addition I have been doing more Amazon shopping, trying to get those last minute Christmas gifts ordered so that they arrive on time.",2.833333333333333,1.0,5.0,2.5,2.6666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,5.0,3.0,6.0,4.5,5.666666666666668,6.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.0,2.5,4.0,5,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.666666666666667,1,33,6,English,1,5,R_3Gm031QQ3paJjSN,-0.0594775,-0.009720344,0.12056931,0.030159997,0.017034724,0.17489533,-0.017015997,0.039922226,0.104632184,0.082557514,-0.07734987,0.053021617,0.10890116,0.17772055,0.0055269636,0.069692746,0.09457986,-0.014599269,-0.03559787,-0.002257077,0.012892864,0.102114454,-0.033694874,0.056610473,0.047843657,0.12412434,0.13274883,0.111111775,0.014006836,0.014547012,0.14233834,0.13333237,0.15600061,0.10304223,0.09489615,-0.087094165,0.025718275,0.006775655,-0.10522751,-0.015462881,-0.09485641,0.2157946,0.026892543,0.021799523,0.045545213,-0.09066416,-0.052034307,-0.091131665,0.020571388,0.101515934,-0.096146375,-0.029987548,0.14663644,0.16677448,0.0998047,0.16400862,0.09899226,0.09057385,0.27372682,0.05995622,0.06476763,0.06526499,-0.018971292,-0.06224184,-0.012631584,0.013634094,0.031630658,0.03187097,0.005128055,0.05952664,0.03182254,0.014893388,0.104197174,0.06900106,0.10975044,0.061609972,0.10410075,-0.008983182,0.073564194,0.09162927,-0.020995317,-0.0680197,-0.049386505,-0.1060638,0.006610809,-0.02298761,-0.050943125,0.14067087,0.07755482,-0.0013255123,0.060862154,-0.010999357,-0.09578466,-0.045836702,-0.071465,-0.040908255,-0.08509418,-0.11091538
A lot of my decisions are made based on how my future will be affected. I include how things will affect my friends and family in my thoughts but my primary focus is how something will enrich or take away from my life. I also live with the thought that I won't regret any decision I make because it's what I thought was in my best interest at that time and I can't change what happened but I can semi-control how it affects my future.,I've eaten breakfast and dinner every day. I went to a birthday party for a friend and was drinking. I worked out. I planned and booked a trip to Alaska. I packed for a trip to Hawaii. I went to my grandma's house to celebrate her birthday.

"I have a few basic, central, and important values in my life which influence how I interact with people and make decisions. One of the most important values to me, is treating everyone with respect and kindly, like how I would like to be treated. Everyone I encounter, I am always polite and smiling. From the interactions I've had in the past when I've been a little rude to people, and they still showed respect and politeness, really took to me. It made me feel better and that I shouldn't have been so rude. This made me realize how important this value is, as simple as it may seem. Another important value to me is honesty. Being honest is always the best approach to everything in life. It shows good character and that you can be relied upon.","This past week was a little more hectic than other weeks, due to the fact that Christmas is right around the corner next week. Everyday as usual, I wake up and get a pot of coffee brewing before washing up to head out to work. I work in retail, so work for my has been filled with customers rushing to buy last minute gifts. I've been so tired from work, that I haven't really had the energy to do much this past week. I went to a Christmas craft festival to look for some small gifts that I could hand out to friends. It helped to brighten my mood and gave me a sense of relaxation. Other than that my week has been pretty mundane and routine. I will probably start packing today after work, to get ready for my trip home next week for the holidays.",5.0,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,2.1666666666666665,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.5,5.666666666666668,5.5,5.0,5.0,5.5,5.5,4.5,5.0,23,2.5,2.0,4.833333333333333,2,28,1,English,3,5,R_Zn0QjuZQle7NxmN,-0.04217869,0.044988014,0.10157941,0.018705146,0.06931148,0.12547643,-0.045919962,0.07952239,0.08448282,0.1135773,-0.025307273,0.04767046,0.18603893,0.23162296,0.0978267,0.05663599,0.10014072,-0.036509715,-0.09631898,-0.021465141,0.03139345,-0.04954662,-0.06196375,0.012060242,0.033924136,0.05122918,0.07617102,-0.051157646,-0.028086213,0.0075775934,0.09667966,0.116162315,0.13972515,0.1709353,0.08884268,-0.08354442,-0.029097874,-0.07085815,-0.13622102,-0.11023633,-0.08581957,0.27435863,0.059006944,0.07329202,0.0138520375,-0.089090586,0.021015648,-0.041701056,0.022910908,0.12215353,-0.014546575,-0.028735822,0.28163415,0.21144232,0.076900735,0.12496041,0.14357679,0.11597376,0.30143458,0.12456324,0.102434106,0.03932871,-0.029936992,-0.012764627,-0.025333783,0.0298538,0.09305091,0.043593753,0.011148188,0.002302329,0.062376738,0.009706542,0.073116854,0.03359883,0.08219451,0.029706657,0.06847441,0.05986963,-0.0103927385,0.083295144,-0.18874216,-0.073705636,-0.037227158,-0.09074822,0.027786989,-0.052416548,0.008844374,0.1993164,-0.057199046,-0.03319514,-0.1330428,-0.053834494,-0.05358784,-0.065993704,-0.105433404,-0.04144931,-0.02148538,-0.10388659
My most important values are my belief in showing everyone kindness even if they don't deserve it. I believe that if you show kindness to people who maybe aren't the nicest it might make them want to show kindness back. I also believe in being as friendly with people as possible so that I can have the best relationship possible with them. I especially feel this way about the people who I have working for me. If I can get along with them and they can get along with me it makes my day to day life so much better. It also helps people want to continue to work for me so that I don't have to spend a bunch of time hiring new people and trying to get them to fit into the team. Another value that I hold dear is honesty. I don't believe in having to lie to anyone about anything. Having honest relationships makes me feel more comfortable because I'm saying everything and anything that needs to be said. It also allows me to teach my sons the importance of honesty so that I'm raising two little boys who I can be proud of.,"Last Friday, I went to work as normal and had a bunch of meetings. After work, I made homemade burritos with my wife before we headed off to bowling. We had to drive slower because it had started snowing a bit earlier that evening. We bowled three games on league with two of our friends who were filling in for our other two friends who were in Mexico. I actually bowled better than I have in weeks so I was pretty happy and I enjoyed two beers while I was at the bowling alley. My wife then drove us to the grocery store after we were done bowling so that we could be prepared for the week. Saturday morning, my wife and I had to get up nice and early so that we could shovel multiple people's houses. We shoveled our friend's house who were in Mexico and while we were there we borrowed their snow blower so that we could take care of my mother-in-laws house, my friends mother's house, and my house. After we finally finished shoveling I sanded and mudded my son's wall because I had to tear it all done the other week. The rest of the day was spent relaxing with my wife. On Sunday, we headed to my grandmother-in-law's house so that we could help decorate her tree. After that we came home and spent time playing video games with our sons. Monday was just another regular day where I had to go to work and then I came home exhausted, but I still took care of doing another coat of the mudding on the wall. Tuesday, I went to work and then after I got to have a game night with my cousin and her husband. We played Descent for hours it was a blast. Wednesday, I went to work and then came home to make dinner with my wife and then watch Rumble with my boys. Thursday, I worked from home so that I could get my booster shot and then my boy's got their flu and covid vaccine. Today, I'm just trying to catch up on what I couldn't finish yesterday while working from home.",4.833333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.1666666666666665,3.0,3.1666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,3.333333333333333,4.0,5.5,3.0,5.333333333333333,2.5,5.5,2.5,5.5,5.5,3.5,6.0,5,3.333333333333333,3.0,3.6666666666666665,2,33,6,English,1,6,R_3EzZpR6LVg5oM2m,0.061942313,0.09366028,0.16236947,0.15756983,0.052457258,0.22658084,0.07088739,0.121022545,0.14445491,0.12370119,-0.018287312,0.022216087,0.06491081,0.14241819,0.075985625,0.06984617,0.11253473,0.05334516,-0.016900897,0.026654534,0.041293476,0.033091217,0.120154604,0.17415822,0.014761271,0.095959365,0.13798043,0.14069542,0.00690192,0.003959749,0.18375048,0.23713088,0.119075425,0.12477321,0.03619195,-0.008994548,0.0585875,0.010258368,-0.050905265,-0.0072875693,-0.035308115,0.19438992,0.15234151,0.017439878,0.15475819,-0.014821064,0.0016435422,0.06588583,0.08737913,0.124296896,0.09257744,0.042727064,0.19081682,0.13284962,0.1701468,0.18328771,0.119804315,0.14550853,0.2876775,0.18400916,0.1505101,0.13465978,0.058032207,0.009970162,0.042522773,0.083112046,0.12847465,0.10100771,0.06040101,0.036709312,0.06956545,0.02430719,0.16352746,0.05072915,0.06431298,0.003208099,0.040561378,0.03487699,0.081798464,0.16597235,-0.11245565,-0.04797544,0.04652989,0.012052234,0.085053414,0.055138037,-0.031055382,0.16505986,0.06027869,0.12756744,-0.027186228,-0.03942098,-0.025276273,0.013753468,-0.026773605,0.056989178,-0.08346298,0.09608853

"The core value that guides my life is justice, in the sense of fairness. I highly value that everyone has the same opportunities, even if it means that some people get a lot more assistance in accessing those opportunities than others. I also believe it is important for each person to get the opportunities that suit them best, so if one person would prefer a career in skilled manual labour, that person should have access to quality training with an expert rather than being funneled into four-year college or something. I believe in a universal basic income and comprehensive healthcare for all. I believe in the inherent value and interconnectedness of all beings, so we must all care for and support one another. I believe in compassion and kindness above all. I value honesty, but only insofar as it is helpful.","Last Friday, we had to stick around the house to wait for a delivery. When the delivery arrived, I left to get groceries while my partner put his new chair together. We watched movies and played board games as a family in the evening. Saturday, we practised martial arts as a family in the back yard, then had friends over to play Dungeons and Dragons in the evening. Sunday was a wonderfully relaxing day watching Elf and then Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Monday, we had to drive out of town to meet my dad to sign some paperwork. It was a nice drive, as we got to listen to Fool Moon by Jim Butcher and the kids behaved well on the trip. We signed our paperwork so quickly and smoothly! It was amazing! Then we went out to lunch at one of my dad's favourite burger joints. It was nice to spend some time with him since I don't get to see him very often. The rest of the week has been more everyday stuff: doing schoolwork with the kids, cleaning the house on Tuesday, and exercising daily. I made time to practise my lightsabre flows yesterday. Today I stayed in bed late to snuggle with the cats and my partner is about to start an interview for a new job right now!",5.0,4.5,2.5,2.1666666666666665,2.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,3.8333333333333335,4.0,6.0,3.5,6.0,3.5,5.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,6.0,5.5,20,3.1666666666666665,2.5,4.5,1,35,7,English,1,5,R_3kvrTqTi3VTNT84,-0.0010665674,0.023951683,0.19516855,0.032755807,0.04928871,0.18279625,0.06717414,0.0933522,0.08820567,0.09408228,-0.074618876,0.07346633,0.13065097,0.17052019,0.12512866,0.07292099,0.05921744,0.06399074,-0.043781545,0.047680356,0.020034026,-0.03323231,0.014714412,0.114442505,0.030779725,0.035139404,0.093306586,0.15020168,-0.037737392,-0.056397893,0.2032297,0.18796447,0.13634571,0.09785211,0.028404964,-0.09933909,0.05834211,0.03281902,-0.063133724,-0.005964131,-0.10749805,0.16838248,0.10842475,-0.032218486,0.07214387,-0.09252457,-0.02827915,0.04920583,0.02907003,0.10623926,0.07472624,0.086131155,0.15552197,0.18902215,0.13758904,0.16349232,0.08270111,0.10073416,0.22144651,0.13353738,0.080149546,0.07011284,0.033795543,-0.012148853,0.058357365,0.095534064,0.15173025,0.10193953,-0.06925319,-0.051547423,0.011316959,-0.055123746,0.059509978,-0.066695824,-0.027455626,-0.11084823,-0.026044695,-0.01651062,0.0012314077,0.11610934,-0.07424864,-0.12028445,-0.006729258,-0.030073129,-0.013537484,-0.039934732,-0.09799732,0.1302762,0.09377085,0.12460203,0.049870994,-0.043770634,0.014221806,-0.03064569,-0.034087725,0.048065215,-0.030189613,-0.00010875892
"2 core values I hold in high esteem is truth with gentleness, and treating everyone with respect (until proven otherwise).  It governs how it interact with everyone from the person in the grocery store to the person looking for a hand up on the street. 
Im not here to judge them simply help where and how I can. Sometimes that mean helping a person or waiting for cooler heads to prevail. Sometimes that means I need to face a wrong that I did by apologizing that I was mistaken or wrong.","I woke up sick, head full of junk, chest feeling like a small child was sitting on it. I rolled over and groaned, thinking, this is going to be fun. I called in sick. I called Quickcare and made myself presentable. 
After spending quality time in Quickcare I gathered my prescriptions and headed over to the local pharmacy. I felt terrible and waited as calmly as I could as kids coughed around me. Adults hacked into sleeves all around me. It was like a zombie horror movie, as I noticed more and more people sick at every turn. 
Was it that many? In truth most likely not. But it was a thought that traveled slowly across my addled brain. 
Once the drugs took effect the next couple of days were a routine; drugs, small amounts of food, lots and lots of liquids. Rinse. Repeat.

"One of the most important values is dedication to one's career/work. I believe this is important as this value informs how you approach both school and work, which will lead you to success and earning an income. This value is also important as it allows you to invest in one's passion, which is one's job typically. Another thing I value is financial responsibility. This is important as this is how you make sure your life functions smoothly, from saving for emergencies and retirement to having a house and a form of transportation. Another thing I value is making the most of free time. This is important as free time is a time to explore and learn about the world, develop your hobbies, and generally cultivate your interests outside of work. This makes the world interesting and provides additional meaning to one's life. These values allow you to meet the right people, care for those around you, and improve the lives of those who are engaged in similar passions as you.","I wake up, check emails and texts and on my phone, then get up. I take a shower then get dressed for remote work. I then have a breakfast which consists of some fruit, and some nuts. I then work for a few hours on my computer at my desk. I then take a lunch break during which I eat some sort of sandwich with meat and a fruit to top it off. I then work for a few more hours. I might do a minor chore or two during the day if I have time. After work is completed in the late afternoon, I try to either get some form of exercise outdoors or run errands. If I am running errands, I usually walk to a nearby grocery store or bike to a store that might be farther away. I never drive to do errands as I do not have a car and I also do not take public transportation. For exercise, I either take a walk around the neighborhood, bike around town or on trails, play sports, or go to the gym where I lift weights. After these things are completed, I usually go home and have a healthy dinner then take a shower. I might browse the internet for a bit then go to bed.

"In my life I try to focus on treating other people with respect and empathy. Everyone has their own ideas about life, what it important, how they should live, and how the world should work. I try to see their point of view, and even if we can't connect on certain issues, I try to be respectful and kind. We are all stuck on Earth, and there is no sense in being cruel to each other. I really want the best for humanity, and our planet, and the universe, and I try to contribute to that by not holding back the development of humanity by squabbling over petty differences. I also promote and participate in charities that provide education and basic needs so that more people can  thrive and contribute to society.","At the beginning of the week, I had my Aunt's funeral. I read a Psalm that my great-grandmother loved, and a few people read poems. We buried her with my great-grandmother. I went back to work after recovering from Covid, and I'm struggling with some anxiety and stress related to work. A few days ago was my boyfriend's birthday. I got him a present, and cooked him dinner and a cake. I also deep cleaned the house that morning. Yesterday we bought a Christmas tree because his mom sent us ornaments, and we haven't had a tree in years since moving in together. I just finished decorating it this morning. I'm currently trying to get my cat to stop chewing it, and I'm thinking of wrapping the bottom of it in a fitted sheet at night when I can't watch him.",4.666666666666667,4.0,3.8333333333333335,2.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,2.0,4.0,3.333333333333333,5.0,5.0,5.333333333333333,5.5,5.5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,9,2.6666666666666665,1.5,4.166666666666667,1,29,7,English,1,3,R_Oebd8ZjrlBNbQQN,0.0073618833,0.12534498,0.1402955,0.008545801,0.058201745,0.17306548,0.00932763,0.13327217,0.09854096,0.10023962,0.00094586983,-0.0017878581,0.10264952,0.19655529,0.08574533,0.05589529,0.15457532,0.13757059,-0.037290417,-0.013412217,0.09047651,-0.006344918,0.049646217,0.10735327,0.05658385,0.041020475,0.04209286,0.06985566,-0.016104084,-0.008547474,0.2167157,0.21111788,0.238369,0.10799577,0.14200702,-0.08396849,0.0010365658,-0.004365273,-0.07016677,-0.017557908,-0.07713144,0.23404461,0.09815687,0.010416174,0.044072412,-0.07747809,-0.023673305,0.071957104,0.05223977,0.04860218,0.10400388,0.108475134,0.23412889,0.089827895,0.14635035,0.12090166,0.06935347,0.1306166,0.27906287,0.14808926,0.06449352,0.06165353,0.100101,0.10307866,0.15413842,0.20449099,0.3316436,0.11069459,-0.046288617,-0.07990593,0.015471529,-0.008615028,0.040898018,0.0072444845,0.009724699,-0.030199803,0.00012465706,0.04408311,-0.006219603,0.07569012,-0.077817574,0.013450261,-0.008679459,-0.034874815,0.011033375,-0.097591974,0.039044257,0.1850566,0.08736882,0.16596985,-0.02600412,-0.023841187,0.124257244,-0.016326346,0.0017472729,0.09666783,0.039936006,-0.024048094
"One of the main values to my life is honesty and sadly last year I did not live up to that standard. I was married for 8 years and then had an emotional affair with an ex girl friend. I have only ever cheated twice in my life and both times were with this girl. I can not say no. 

I tried to hide it for about a month and then finally had to come clean and tell my wife what was going on. Even though it was tough and hurt, I told my wife the whole truth, while it did lead to divorce, being honest is always the best thing a person can do. I wish I would have stuck to my values and told my ex wife what was wrong in our marriage and what I was feeling/thinking.","I do pretty much the same thing Monday through Friday. 

I wake up at 5 am and then take a pee, by 5:05 I am sitting in my chair and my wife is bringing me breakfast, I then eat breakfast and by 5:30 I am petting the cat good bye and kissing my wife as I walk out the door. I head down stairs and scrape the truck and then head to the bus barn. 

I drive bus from 5:45 to 8 am, and then park the bus and head into the school to shower. By 8:15 I am out of the shower and read to teach. I teach PE from 8:30 - 3:30.

"I think one of my most basic values is honesty. No matter what the situation or what the outcome, honesty plays the biggest role as who I am as a person for many reasons. I want people to trust me, I want people to value my opinion and I want people to feel safe when they are with me. I think another basic value I have is empathy/compassion. I always try to find the good in people even if there really isn't any. I try to understand where they are coming from, even if it is not something I agree with. Another huge value for me is giving. Whether it's giving time, assistance or advise, I love to be able to give back to others. While I am not always in a position to give to places or people financially, I am often able to give in other ways.","The past week has been fairly eventful. As we prepare for the upcoming Christmas holiday and wrap up school for my children for the year and finish up sports until the new year, hectic would be the first word that comes to mind to describe our week. Starting with Saturday, my day was spent driving several hours away to pick up my sons Christmas present up (he is getting a new KTM 85cc dirt bike). After picking that up, I headed to the outlet mall to make some smaller item purchases. I then went home, played with my kids and we went to bed. On Sunday, we picked up a friend and spent our afternoon at our local cities Christmas parade. While we enjoyed it, it was definitely geared towards younger children. From Monday through Friday, our days are fairly routine. We wake up, I drop the kids off at each of their schools, drive about an hour and a half to work, work and then leave work to pick them up. Monday evening, my son had wrestling practice and my daughter had basketball practice. Tuesday evening, my son had a wrestling tournament and my daughter had a basketball practice. Wednesday evening, my son had wrestling practice and afterwards we went to the store to pick up items we needed to prepare for my daughters school festivities on Thursday. We then spent our evening making finger sandwiches (ham & cheese, turkey & cheese and pb&j) and dirt cups (jello, oreos and gummy worms). Thursday evening, my son had wrestling practice and my daughter had basketball pictures as well as hitting lessons.",4.833333333333333,1.8333333333333333,2.0,4.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,2.833333333333333,3.0,4.0,5.5,3.5,5.333333333333333,3.0,4.0,5.5,5.0,5.5,3.5,6.0,19,3.1666666666666665,4.5,3.8333333333333335,1,41,1,English,1,3,R_Th0nmKTjiTYUkNz,0.034351088,0.014119698,0.12991656,0.04539451,0.06281126,0.14237379,0.055303562,0.16057602,0.11910349,0.15817852,-0.09337032,0.076155804,0.15226854,0.20985954,0.053762183,0.048371583,0.068030976,0.03960041,-0.10891813,0.03363647,0.045010697,0.011631887,-0.0031252448,0.06230299,0.08353038,0.07656591,0.081347756,0.11811776,0.0084225,-0.011792915,0.1362873,0.17936727,0.13453254,0.09511549,0.059148103,-0.081105806,0.03611726,0.072319895,-0.08970684,-0.0125624165,-0.08223842,0.186384,0.09038498,-0.029381879,0.08175312,-0.04837995,-0.01878401,0.0061567537,0.05412172,0.07610794,-0.013029086,-0.034836046,0.18569094,0.16878979,0.08459889,0.12720287,0.10453041,0.10488084,0.23387615,0.10314055,0.06409088,0.095687084,-0.021540215,-0.043459564,-0.009515863,0.045447223,0.028183952,0.022148544,0.03460657,-0.010385413,0.06616116,-0.0020719208,0.14956927,-0.016307909,0.0046762796,0.027170632,0.015411941,0.017781548,-0.031266473,0.058573805,0.049961336,-0.08502577,0.01477385,-0.02030161,0.088645436,0.08761486,0.020174205,0.20322001,0.13408351,0.049367733,0.1337368,-0.037099075,-0.01563485,-0.022073565,-0.026828721,-0.015294883,-0.08868258,-0.00025136583
"My core values are authenticity, empathy, sustainability, kindness, and open-mindedness. These values guide every aspect of my daily life. They are equally important to me. Every word I speak, and every action I take is guided by these principles. Of course, I slip up sometimes. I am not perfect. For the most part, though, I try my very best to live these values and to practice what I preach. It makes me love myself, my friends & family, and the world more when I stand by my values. It helps me to become the best version of myself. My biggest goal in life is to affect positive change!","Last Friday, I woke up feeling festive and decided to decorate the house for Christmas! After a delicious egg & cheese bagel sandwich breakfast, I took my furbabies for a walk. Then, I fed them, and got to work on the house. It was so much fun! Saturday & Sunday were spent relaxing with my husband. We played video games, cooked a lot of food together, and tidied up the house. Monday, I ate a hearty breakfast, took the dogs for a walk, then fed them. I spent the rest of the day working on microtasks for Amazon Mechanical Turk. Tuesday, Wednesday, & Thursday were spent the same way. Today, I woke up and went to our local food pantry. I got lots of fresh and canned food for Christmas! I was also given a live Christmas tree! It has been a great week, full of kindness, love, and relaxation!",5.0,4.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,4.166666666666667,5.5,3.5,6.0,3.5,3.0,5.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,15,3.333333333333333,2.5,4.0,1,35,7,English,1,3,R_1K2qEZfGKsZqFiu,0.038460273,0.05515638,0.11629342,0.01801929,0.09817937,0.19715145,0.044213325,0.1391957,0.16824383,0.18828097,-0.024699058,0.05535523,0.168455,0.19311999,0.13420245,0.05129955,0.04372403,0.016681034,-0.046512786,0.009274075,0.036566406,0.12416693,-0.016916582,0.059858393,0.052998748,0.06371457,0.14540935,0.07637669,0.037423227,-0.045947623,0.12982583,0.13689265,0.10032706,0.20768636,0.044203088,-0.01274422,0.04917767,0.04231921,-0.0472011,-0.02700617,-0.015741125,0.21628904,0.08593336,0.040121637,0.09408559,0.006885822,0.058875073,0.040449057,0.082055256,0.1181895,0.031180752,0.02745725,0.32788414,0.13361484,0.13039704,0.1424834,0.16924432,0.15920883,0.307686,0.14986649,0.2305142,0.09424357,0.02301787,0.035346404,0.044977687,0.12088281,0.12757525,0.16321193,0.034368783,0.046837136,0.12233411,0.0015307833,0.16857645,0.10138807,0.06392298,0.077393405,0.065194234,0.1645284,0.05874188,0.13947919,-0.06612989,0.03941116,0.07144702,-0.046966743,0.03772894,-0.06294194,0.044772968,0.20906965,-0.0016449816,0.08491781,-0.044101313,-0.04851919,0.04045011,0.0052344874,0.030560125,0.114929065,0.009261733,-0.00081726164
"The most important things in my life are my faith and my family.  I am a Christian, so my Christian worldview impacts every decision I make.  What I do, how I speak to people, and how I act are all impacted by my faith.  In addition to my faith, my relationship with the members of my family is paramount.  I think about family all day every day and wonder how they are doing and how I can be of support to them.  I don't mean to imply that I don't have my own life and I do pursue my own interests, but family opinion and support is what I value the most.","Last week I was on vacation in Hawaii.  I had a great time and spent most of my time lying around the pool area, swimming in the ocean and walking along the beach.  We did go out on a boat trip that included snorkeling.  That was so much fun and we were able to see marine life that I had never encountered before.  Following the boat ride we stopped for lunch at a restaurant that is famous for their mai tai's.  They were fantastic.

Once the vacation ended, it took me almost an entire day to get home.  I had multiple layovers in various airports and spent most of my time there walking up and down the concourses trying to keep myself awake as well as get some exercise.  

Now I am home and life has settled back into my normal routine of up early at 4:45 AM to walk 5 miles, then work, then home to spend time with my husband and dogs.",4.166666666666667,1.3333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.5,3.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.1666666666666665,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,4.5,3.5,5.0,5.0,2.5,5.5,26,3.0,4.5,4.166666666666667,1,50,1,English,1,6,R_31ycSRKh1aWAaw5,0.03623454,0.10368973,0.22810778,0.12527265,0.065724716,0.22205631,0.020906655,0.028977767,0.1174074,0.081193164,8.062273e-05,0.022852495,0.18967928,0.32820243,0.17019711,0.16199245,0.12135871,-0.020297311,-0.031847183,0.08125949,0.058996666,-0.0340323,-0.06137929,0.039534304,-0.022304,-0.0042504407,0.033581924,0.013803693,0.025714368,0.056465633,0.12761341,0.20407489,0.13712329,0.1626594,0.118429035,0.0031613037,0.008795867,0.032470506,0.0025561117,-0.0494444,-0.010459192,0.24429369,0.11424287,0.08351544,0.02667909,-0.03427426,0.043567013,0.12759805,0.10659694,0.13103189,0.17295024,0.097444996,0.13764706,0.31772602,0.1347235,0.17986353,0.07754728,0.09344279,0.24254131,0.16058512,0.116730876,0.103615664,0.07540499,0.028881505,0.050565615,0.12889946,0.1469722,0.07713573,0.031743377,0.014742538,0.076452166,-0.002524633,0.00518314,0.01164999,0.035859175,-0.031009102,-0.03739331,0.013141265,0.031960048,0.12922825,-0.09772473,-0.019636825,0.045843903,0.010270745,0.046520162,-0.02111249,-0.026697788,0.14525777,0.0114857545,0.04625238,-0.10350831,-0.04318071,0.028121183,0.0024870597,-0.04573559,0.013270497,-0.0072629424,0.019711653
"The most important and influential thing in my life is when I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord.  I was young at the time, but I knew I needed to have a relationship with God and that I could.  I was raised in a Christian home and my values and guiding principles come from having an active faith in Christ.  I get my values from the Bible.  That is why I am against abortion, etc.  I had an eight-year-old son who was diagnosed with bone cancer.  For almost two years he fought and struggled with it.  He had an amputation of his left leg, two lung surgeries, and at least a year of chemo.  Through it all, he kept a happy disposition.  He could find joy in life.  When a newspaper reporter asked him how he could be so happy, he replied, ""I know that Jesus will never leave or forsake me.""  He died peacefully at the age of 10.  That is the kind of peace and faith Jesus gives us.  He has promised to never leave us.  Although I don't understand all the hard things people go through and the difficult things in life, I can trust that God is sovereign and will make everything right soon.","I can't remember too well what I did on Friday and Saturday of last week.  Probably the typical day-to-day type of things--getting up and dressed, eating breakfast, checking email, doing MTurk, fixing lunch, doing dishes, maybe going to the store, etc.  
On Sunday we drove half an hour to the church where I taught the Senior Ladies Bible Study class and then attended the church service with my husband.  After church, we had a Women's Ministry meeting where we ate lunch and discussed the issues of our Ministry to Women.  After that, we drove home and I caught up on my computer items and did daily chores and routines.  Several times this week we went to the store to get items we needed.  On Tuesday, after doctor's appointments and errands, we drove to KC to check on a car we wanted to buy.  We were there early and waited to meet him.  We ended up buying the car and I had to drive one car home, following my husband.  That was grueling!  I hate to drive, it was at night and there was a lot of traffic.  But we made it home.  On Wednesday we had an appointment with the Pest Control to put out bait boxes for mice.  On Thursday we received a portable dishwasher that we had ordered.  It was a very busy week.

"The main central value of my life is honesty. If more people were truthful, telling it like it is, the world would be far better off. People don't need things sugar coated, they want to hear things as they truly are. This doesn't mean one has to be rude or hurtful while being truthful, but it does mean giving an honest assessment.","A week ago, I woke up, took my dog out, and started working. Then I fed my dog and took her for a walk. I continued to work until the afternoon, when I took her out again. I started making dinner, ate, watched TV and went to bed. The weekend was filled with football games and house cleaning. I ordered things on Amazon. I went to the grocery store. I went on some long walks.

"The most fundamental value that guides me is integrity. This stands as the basis for all of my other values, because without I could give up on my other values. It is to upmost importance to me that I am true to myself and adhere to my beliefs. There was a time in my life when I would maybe go against who I was, even if just for a moment, to be accepted or not stand out. Those days are surely behind me. When I think of all the times I wasn't true to myself, I never want to be like that again. Staying true to not only myself, but to the ethics and morals that govern my way of life have never been more important to me. Fairness is at the base of my values when interacting with others. I know what it feels like and means to be treated unfairly and I don't want anyone to ever feel like I am doing that to them. I put in as much effort as I can to be fair to anyone I am interacting with. There was a time when being fair wasn't as important to me as it is now. I don't remember too much about that time, but I do remember that when I started to feel I was being treated unfairly I didn't want anyone to feel that from me. I wanted to be somebody who took everyone into consideration and be aware of their unique situation. Whatever it may be. I would say those are the most important values that I hold the closest to my heart and am not willing to compromise.","Everyday for the last seven days I have eaten food, but only past 2pm. This isn't scheduled or forced. I've never been a big breakfast eater. I don't get hungry until a certain time and I prefer to only eat when I'm hungry. For the last 3 days I have exercised extensively and feel great. I don't have any back pain and like do as many pushups as I can before I am exhausted. I go outside with my dog sometimes, but only when he has to use the bathroom, because it's cold and I am not a fan of winter. I made a video for one of my social media accounts. It did better than what I thought it would so I think I'll make another one soon. I edited for about 2 days. I know why people pay editors so much money now. It's because no one wants to do it! I have tons of goals I need to make before the month is up so I've been focusing on those, but when I have free time I like to play with my dog. If he's had enough of me, than I turn to one of the games on my phone.",4.833333333333333,3.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.6666666666666665,4.166666666666667,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,3.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,6.0,6.0,18,3.1666666666666665,3.0,3.5,2,28,1,English,2,3,R_XZZefOhOWxu8kBH,-0.032494687,0.051279653,0.21536215,0.1124115,0.014778551,0.17031172,0.046503134,0.015805176,0.092336155,0.15860245,-0.041625597,0.08168395,0.10187284,0.18348035,0.06841883,0.08031295,0.07629578,-0.034631502,0.0077401623,-0.017851178,0.036339212,0.058584943,0.019754304,-0.039277866,0.015155643,0.012242019,0.06835385,-0.061464388,0.04217146,0.0067091417,0.15782505,0.19006023,0.19117457,0.10811892,0.18005309,-0.08350557,0.018549906,-0.008981701,-0.02244144,-0.057705488,-0.08868019,0.22637588,0.17586091,0.08520876,0.01911784,-0.12083728,-0.060794435,0.052928362,0.11435516,0.12933192,0.021961998,0.041223023,0.07853868,0.20831576,0.1271439,0.16243443,0.028886134,0.0532463,0.26401585,0.13169917,0.12741384,0.117822856,0.0044101514,-0.035595506,-0.0070100725,-0.01150891,0.016688783,0.052042753,0.018787406,-0.03218119,0.069420226,0.005202651,0.0804314,0.012609934,0.05205025,0.03662903,0.014750624,-0.050930105,-0.0071629733,0.0348631,-0.09805751,-0.091451295,-0.05017583,-0.04185395,-0.027416857,-0.013407634,-0.1003382,0.036905088,-0.0034871446,0.030685335,-0.06443164,-0.0030309632,-0.015357552,-0.07136675,-0.03491918,-0.031542454,0.027920509,-0.09431039

"I believe in trying to leave no one worse than when I first encounter them. What I mean is that I try to not harm or take advantage of others. It's like the golden rule, or karma. I also think it's important to make an effort to be good to our planet, so I recycle and don't litter. I also think that people's time and lives are important. I think everyone deserves the opportunity to play and learn, instead of just work. That goes for children as well as adults. I am trying to take more value in my health, as I neglected it in the past. So in my household I am trying to set a good example for my child without being to strict about it.","I have been grocery shopping. This entails looking at the local sales ads for grocery stores and taking note of anything that I would like to eat that is being offered at a discount. I then looked in my kitchen for staples that I needed to pick up. I then made a menu for the week, keeping in mind what I had decided I needed and what was on sale. I then made  a list of what to buy. I also taught homeschool to my child. Got gas for the car. Cleaned the house and made many meals from scratch. I was able to get a sitter for a few hours to do some christmas shopping, and wrap some presents.

"I believe in honesty, integrity and loyalty. I show this by sticking to my values and promises to others and to myself. I follow three main principals, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t steal. I believe in God and have moderate spirituality. Some do not believe anymore and I do not judge them because it’s not up to me to live others lives and make choices for them. It’s just good values and life rules to help life flow easily. I believe in working hard and giving whatever your passion is your full effort. And having little to no regrets. You only get one shot at life and you should be happy and help to enrich others lives as well. I try not to judge others choices and accept people for who they are and the special gifts they have to offer.",Over the last seven days I have gone to a couple dinners for the Christmas holiday. It was very nice to see my friends because I have not been able to for quite some time. I’ve taken care of usual household chores and have gone shopping. I bought nice outfits for myself and gifts for my family,4.833333333333333,3.1666666666666665,2.833333333333333,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.166666666666667,3.6666666666666665,5.5,4.5,5.333333333333333,5.0,5.5,6.0,4.5,6.0,6.0,6.0,14,2.833333333333333,3.5,3.333333333333333,1,43,1,English,1,3,R_1j8TzMD4mb98aJc,0.11744594,0.096532285,0.065842375,0.07466005,0.1695688,0.18681629,0.080324024,0.15706474,0.15390195,0.19283587,0.0019472893,0.13013394,0.2954499,0.34107482,0.14331564,0.06776751,0.08264884,-0.06577323,-0.013558876,0.0030804966,0.08375872,0.07960388,-0.0054928428,0.09329839,0.06564766,0.12131429,0.10384272,-0.01457978,0.054780554,-0.03860601,0.11387792,0.072144,0.011782577,0.139276,-0.028780995,0.09722192,0.067170665,0.04323408,0.002826754,0.015686147,0.04218199,0.15558392,0.0639206,0.16498354,0.1990809,0.013880864,0.10045004,-0.036980566,0.17802602,0.17084508,0.10193002,0.06584816,0.3080135,0.18895224,0.170539,0.22182178,0.24075481,0.23343113,0.3759378,0.20367154,0.22276516,0.18515834,0.090693936,0.0646294,0.0046360344,0.1363065,0.05007252,0.094737455,0.022226598,0.04266105,0.0504246,0.09269578,0.055000134,0.09939398,0.003252359,-0.008687563,-0.011612185,0.117841974,0.011330599,0.19616538,-0.11193377,0.056100644,0.022609975,-0.08006394,0.0434165,-0.012616204,0.103819005,0.26263478,0.056309193,0.048502922,-0.053056553,0.03779939,-0.006177025,0.10417829,-0.021731686,0.13500358,-0.11797008,0.086385556
"Something that I will always live by is to treat others how I would want myself to be treated, although it is not always clear to me. I remember this principle because whenever I am not sure how I feel about someone, I try to think through and imagine how I'd want to be treated if I was in their place, and go from there. It's helped me throughout life to just stop and think before making decisions, even if they are everyday decisions. I believe that a person's habits really determine who they are, so I try to implement this in my every day life to make these behaviors habitual for myself. 

For example, I have had friends who were too afraid to tell me how they really feel about certain things, and it has only made things harder. The best thing to do is to just be straight forward without loosing control of your emotions.","Last week ago today was a Friday and a very busy weekend, I picked up my girlfriend from the airport and drove her and her parents home. Literally the next morning we were already moving her things to her new home with her roommates, and that process took the entire weekend since they had a lot of things. It was tiring but definitely worth it since she lives closer to me now. And they fed us so it wasn't bad. Monday hit and the work week started for me, busy schedule leading up to the holiday season. I needed to get as much done as I could before this upcoming weekend, because I will be once again busy with my girlfriend at her graduation party. I am starting to realize she takes a lot of my time, but she's worth every second. Anyways I did my normal habits this week, brushing my teeth and showering everyday after I woke up. Then eating breakfast, and the rest of the day depends on which day it was. Monday I applied to some software engineering jobs and interviewed with 2 companies, went pretty well. One rejected me due to a better candidate but I am still waiting on the other. Rest of the week I did work related to my stock market positions and shoe business.",3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.8333333333333335,3.333333333333333,2.5,2.5,4.5,4.166666666666667,6.0,6.0,5.0,5.5,5.0,5.5,2.0,2.0,5.5,5.0,11,3.333333333333333,5.0,4.0,2,22,6,English,3,5,R_sieENtdGuncKSrv,-0.0011937106,-0.025670623,0.15199009,0.06398693,-0.053330805,0.080119945,-0.048281882,-0.028603662,-0.04334016,-0.026456177,-0.17109954,-0.07072348,0.003670603,0.07340968,-0.01959833,0.042215522,0.049288232,0.024512794,-0.053467266,0.021355454,-0.0168407,-0.029287733,-0.053430922,0.07278768,0.023576684,0.03939538,0.042170778,-0.004617743,-0.0024856813,0.010728635,0.07214922,0.13135473,0.11199131,0.019135373,0.08115715,-0.07178392,0.0044800825,-0.034003325,-0.09076857,-0.028337516,-0.09289111,0.15081668,0.13109064,-0.03400007,-0.0030661738,-0.13939065,-0.062057607,-0.07262076,-0.044269867,0.093073085,-0.020883523,-0.047849394,0.07095433,0.09153504,0.04114444,0.12239736,0.039027736,0.023319127,0.19485515,0.033101004,-0.04860453,0.14159656,-0.04494301,-0.113015234,-0.08005731,-0.0754653,-0.009223187,0.013898807,-0.007070616,-0.024269093,0.02351903,-0.051095396,0.036424242,-0.04748504,0.032638937,-0.06594742,0.06879926,-0.11485742,0.002877106,0.034605518,-0.14884147,-0.10218662,-0.12012851,-0.07227493,-0.057515346,-0.017362278,-0.11039415,0.00609078,0.01865554,-0.047377016,-0.16419873,-0.113970265,-0.12072009,-0.06552918,-0.10783825,-0.039547615,-0.05752942,-0.09738649
"I try very hard to approach each situation with an open mind and an open heart. I tend to be quick to anger and judgement, so I am trying very hard to work on that aspect of myself. It's important for me to treat others with the level of respect I'd like to receive in return. I think that in light of recent events, it is especially important to treat others with kindness and care.","I have had a rather busy week. My child is starring in a production this week, so I have been carpooling to rehearsals every single day this week. My other child had a special performance this morning, so I attended that, as well. Outside of my children's activities, it has been a slower week for me. I have not had the time to put in my typical work around the house. I have made dinner and washed dishes. I've also tackled several loads of laundry. Unfortunately, this has left little time for my online work and responsibilities.

"The most important values that guide my life are honesty, loyalty, trust, fairness and virtue. I value honesty because it helps people to communicate with each other better. When people communicate, there are fewer misunderstandings. I also think society and relationships cannot function without people being honest. I also value loyalty. Loyalty is important in a relationship because we need to know someone will be there for us when times are bad. I want to know that I can trust someone to take care of things. Fairness in life is important because everyone should be able to share in the earth's riches equally. Virtue is important in relationships because society cannot function when people have low moral standards. The world would erupt into chaos without all of these values being followed by people.","Over the last seven days, I went out for breakfast, and ate along the Berkeley Marina and went grocery shopping with my husband. I put up my Christmas tree. I sent my sister-in-law a birthday text. I went to the dentist, and charged up my car at the EV station. I paid some bills online, and FaceTimed my granddaughter and husband. I worked out on the treadmill. I watched a lot of tv. I washed a few loads of clothes and towels. I did some online shopping and bought my stepdaughters their Christmas presents.

Principles that guide my life are honesty and open-mindedness. I Like to make sure that all of my interactions are honest in nature and that people feel that they can talk to me or work with me and not be taken advantage of. Being open to new expeierences is also very important to me because that is how I can grow as a person and learn more and meet new people.,"For the last 7 days i have worked 6 of them. I work in healthcare and we are very short staffed. On my one day off I did laundry, played with dogs, spent time with my children and boyfriend. We cooked dinner and had icecream. I spent an hour in the pickup line to pick up my son. We had lunch at burger-fi which was a new experience for me. I spend 10 hours at work each day and 2 hours driving to and from. I usually listen to radio in the morning and music or tv shows on my way home. When i get home i usually take care of the dogs and spend an hour or so watching television before bed after showering.",4.5,2.1666666666666665,4.5,3.0,3.1666666666666665,1.1666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.0,5.5,3.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,2.5,4.0,5.5,6.0,12,3.5,3.5,3.8333333333333335,1,31,6,ENGLISH,1,6,R_2YCVK6WjRMP1hMg,0.03629581,-0.0036536972,0.23160052,0.093609616,0.08427271,0.2542771,0.09366886,0.054631107,0.14906093,0.1148107,0.017861776,0.13301691,0.32981497,0.3806042,0.15716463,0.072878316,0.058458626,-0.04665105,-0.03949663,0.045764353,0.039631456,0.12167272,-0.0071896,0.07005013,0.045073755,0.033347845,0.16455823,0.15237078,-0.008020486,0.033404313,0.16325158,0.11398856,-0.011672364,0.20494115,0.0750618,-0.025020106,0.03989896,0.04593092,-0.015901603,-0.089553446,-0.02187615,0.19137922,0.11169493,0.12957487,0.08642979,0.015312682,0.10855079,0.008002958,0.09558446,0.17633832,0.08544466,0.07893456,0.06629424,0.22324216,0.074002236,0.1568477,0.063609816,0.1016707,0.23039794,0.13983029,0.25060353,0.11038548,0.06446473,0.053757142,0.104446605,0.12418397,0.06990964,0.105817914,0.08577658,0.09805593,0.12279867,0.11815871,0.07480767,0.09725702,0.16226763,0.025061114,0.13101079,0.06085974,0.092098966,0.12660176,-0.023525057,-0.03727168,-0.012087765,-0.06850526,-0.07417131,-0.00059368415,-0.03904201,0.11110562,0.022647383,0.07129437,0.008859103,-0.017183343,-0.04711084,-0.040192813,-0.06248012,0.05440324,-0.034167774,0.020544484
"My most important values can be synthesized into one: being true to myself at all times. 

I'm at an age now where I'm able to be honest with myself and accept myself, flaws and all. So that's how I approach life. 

I realize what other people think of me is none of my business, nor my concern. I focus on how I feel about myself. And I strive to be a better version of myself each day for myself, not approval from others.

I want to be kind to myself and others and accept that I'm not perfect, and neither is anyone else. We're all flawed. And I think that's made life a lot easier for me.","During the past seven days, I've been working, reading, writing and returning e-mail, spending time with loved ones, listening to music, playing video games, cooking, housekeeping and meditating.",3.5,1.1666666666666667,4.666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,2.333333333333333,2.0,4.5,1.6666666666666667,6.0,3.0,3.333333333333333,4.5,4.5,4.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,4.5,19,2.333333333333333,3.5,3.0,1,52,6,English,8,3,R_12aSDouBi3uUD70,0.05439687,0.16250905,0.17254004,0.19633184,0.11881247,0.2214258,0.07263737,0.07010747,0.1827594,0.16293943,0.11853085,0.23592637,0.35099596,0.520699,0.35460138,0.240493,0.29961485,0.02158336,0.034923505,0.0770054,0.24457948,0.07867634,-0.028548162,0.079520814,0.038932893,0.024035638,0.20539178,0.029048728,0.05631906,0.026916444,0.22185749,0.22157173,0.19284645,0.28012133,0.21486193,-0.0020168647,-0.011410934,-0.038718186,-0.024070106,-0.07315335,-0.038375497,0.33299643,0.14425372,0.23338053,0.15239683,-0.028833471,0.24103077,0.063462175,0.2310302,0.30965722,0.18013471,0.13581572,0.18562324,0.3424533,0.14205185,0.24774122,0.1313937,0.23830406,0.33868575,0.32210577,0.3253651,0.15101086,0.15569712,0.101205476,0.10077022,0.19704017,0.11986746,0.18399377,0.042154707,0.0063977055,0.07183868,0.037157618,0.0018982622,0.030479092,0.0821055,-0.0128569575,0.051961873,0.11717984,0.041602142,0.2367712,-0.0874861,-0.03333091,0.012847893,-0.049331944,-0.0034539923,-0.04983109,-0.0052312277,0.12199415,0.0058061536,0.1474384,-0.08228042,-0.018239405,0.05110997,0.036012225,-0.07510713,0.03701227,0.004050603,0.10532783
"One of the central and most important values that guides my like is peoples' right to privacy. It is for that reason that I will not be discussing my other values at this time, because even though my identity is protected information for this study, I do not know where the written contents may appear or be quoted, and so this information could potentially be used to identify me. Being able to choose what to reveal about oneself is as important as being able to wear clothing in public. It is as important as being able to decline strip searches. We all deserve the right to choose what to share.","Most every day this past week started like this: woke up, started coffee. Felt g the usual morning fuzzyhead. Worked on mTurk for a while. Feeling the usual alternating interest and boredom. Had lunch and felt the need for a nap. Felt sleepy. Got up from nap, feeling fresher. Some days I then took care of necessary shopping. This would be things like grocery shopping, the post office, or the drug store. Other days I went out to do a few hours gardening. After gardening I felt sweaty but satisfied. Came in, played some computer games while cooling off, then started dinner. Every evening I watched TV with dinner and eventually went to bed, tired but satisfied with the day.

"The central and most important values that define my life are kindness, and a concept of ""live and let live,"" as long as it's not hurting anyone or anything around you.   My deepest thoughts are about being empathetic, kind, compassionate and generous with my caring for others.  This includes animals and the environment.   To make difficult decisions, I use my spiritual Christian based guiding principals.  I try to think of what adheres to my morals and ethics based on what I believe in.  I try to remember to live well, speak well, not judge others and to forgive others.  I try to interact with people in pure kindness without judgement on their situation.  These values in relation to who I am?  Kindness, non judgement and empathy--  I try to look at everyone through their own eyes. I try to find the best in people and interact with them like I would want people to treat me.  I try to extend to others anything and everything that I would want extended to me.","I really do the same thing almost every day.  In the past seven days, I have worked from home, studied languages, walked my dogs, played music (guitar) read books, listened to audiobooks, cooked and ate dinner with my partner, scrolled through social media, played scrabble, painted a little bit, did a puzzle with my step kids at one point, and that was about it.  One thing I engaged in a week ago that I'm still doing is a painting that I began working on.  I started a winter scene on oil painting and have been trying to work on it for at least 10 minutes every day, hoping that I could finish it by the end of the year.  I did not leave the house once in the past week.  My car has been broken down and I have had to get grocery delivery. Luckily, I have the option of working from home, but I haven't been able to run to the store or places that I needed to go, so I have not left the house once, except to walk the dogs around the block in the yard.",4.833333333333333,3.8333333333333335,4.166666666666667,3.1666666666666665,4.166666666666667,4.166666666666667,3.1666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,4.5,3.0,5.333333333333333,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,5.0,3.5,4.5,16,2.333333333333333,6.0,3.8333333333333335,2,43,1,English,1,3,R_1nYG0UYQxj3nymA,0.0043309517,0.11884367,0.22948703,0.1527808,0.021242559,0.2640996,0.022600714,0.032001242,0.16592905,0.04493289,-0.02607869,0.13342072,0.19681486,0.3686375,0.11227167,0.16399807,0.16516508,-0.017037235,-0.0401413,0.0033593662,0.041660093,0.024881614,-0.0063048815,0.06929219,0.021784164,0.008247345,0.12331583,-0.0067465007,0.022197252,0.13613693,0.22136311,0.21962628,0.2767979,0.2608053,0.2774266,-0.013418397,0.0061158454,-0.039811876,-0.042523153,-0.07683294,-0.026076358,0.3928753,0.15754515,0.16480257,0.04187209,-0.09613463,0.12514818,0.041214727,0.13512172,0.2001933,0.09682535,0.030565722,0.21992765,0.3561532,0.1320459,0.20597821,0.062763505,0.116533615,0.2722943,0.13434389,0.1544964,0.07411516,0.027744595,-0.013738066,-0.0034089144,0.08620463,0.047360204,0.07114639,0.03410712,0.041694712,0.05421881,0.033541784,0.078582704,0.014766831,0.11343971,-0.015736941,0.006975402,-0.0143928565,0.015086281,0.074237816,-0.09740311,-0.0791995,-0.032034855,-0.1088116,-0.07762425,-0.13600403,-0.016269587,0.13439217,0.0032622349,0.06586851,-0.052790157,-0.055530857,-0.09160162,-0.032025136,-0.08256552,-0.026548836,0.013771426,-0.04807649
"My most important values are to take care of myself, and to try to treat people as I would want to be treated. I've been struggling with depression on and off for several years now, and it's made it quite difficult to get my life together. Moreover, it worries everyone around me, and I don't want that either. So I'm trying to eat better and exercise, and spent less time in my bedroom when I could be out socializing. I have a bit of a short temper and little patience at times, so sometimes I say things I don't actually mean.  I want to be better and treat people better than that. I also don't like to give up, because I dislike any form of losing, and giving up is losing to myself","I haven't been as productive as a I would've liked this week. I spent way too long practicing smash bros online, and even with that, my practice wasn't as structured as it should've been. I did surveys on mturk every day for at least a couple of hours. On sunday, I made french toast. I helped my my mom make dinner the next day. I played fire emblem for a bit one evening. Recently, I've been watching disguised toast's old among us videos. I'm somehow already nostalgic for them. I went to a smash bros tournament on thursday night, and I didn't do very well.

"My three most core values would be intelligence, compassion, and fun; if someone doesn't show all of these I will most likely not like them as a person.  For intelligence I can not stand an anti-vaxxer, science denier, or someone so idiotic that they believe JFK is going to return to life.  For compassion, I want to help those in need at any cost, as long as people are homeless, going hungry, or struggling to survive, we as a country aren't doing our job.  If I see someone miss treating someone, looking down on someone, or treating someone like a lesser human, it infuriates me and I will very likely step in.  Finally for fun, I believe that people put too much emphasis on work, some people make it the center of their life.  If they enjoy it then that's fine, more power to you; but to me work is work.  It is not the center of my life, and I find it sad that so many people devote their life to a company or business that doesn't care about them at all.  I want to be me, I want to do things for me, and as long as the bills are paid, I would rather the rest of my life to be filled with fun things.","In the past 7 days I haven't really done much exciting, my daily activities are I wake up at 11am and start remote work at 12pm.  I work until 5-6pm and use MTurks to fill in the gaps when nothing is going on.  I eat breakfast at any random time after 2 since eating after waking up makes me deathly sick.  I work in network analysis and monitor traffic for businesses around my area to stop any malicious traffic or patch any type of security holes in their network.  After I finish work I either play my Nintendo Switch or my PC games for most of the night with my girlfriend.  I cook dinner maybe twice a week for us, I specialize in cooking Kung Pow Chicken.  I also take my dog out each day for 4 times, but the past week it hasn't been warm enough to take her out to a park like I would like to do.",5.0,4.833333333333333,2.6666666666666665,2.833333333333333,2.6666666666666665,1.1666666666666667,4.166666666666667,4.666666666666667,6.0,2.5,5.666666666666668,3.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,4.5,6.0,6.0,5,2.5,1.0,2.5,2,30,6,English,1,5,R_2Vka7uh1SoNDbNI,-0.035756044,0.07038353,0.17835425,0.112425596,0.033842027,0.21630806,-0.062805906,0.010602818,0.09586147,0.08651377,-0.02172025,0.0635354,0.17237118,0.26744926,0.11115949,0.13815717,0.13705623,0.0069678836,0.007528612,0.053068664,0.06656079,0.04263805,0.014862306,0.04329123,0.019756544,-0.022414546,0.14715534,0.030817635,0.029034527,0.017646177,0.1318413,0.21878058,0.17926112,0.15867615,0.19591781,0.03225679,0.057865847,0.05446128,-0.0012098644,-0.034807254,-0.0004270021,0.2958804,0.07837179,0.13646722,0.058911048,-0.053824168,-0.013493184,0.06669561,0.11140516,0.17109081,0.12973727,0.11821154,0.12822771,0.28393254,0.15823424,0.20497394,0.02443473,0.12940699,0.27719843,0.13773875,0.10811129,0.082198225,0.010845203,-0.03230359,-0.0079593025,0.01968047,0.094703645,0.06019485,0.0077849645,0.03635219,0.086367145,0.02184787,0.042895496,0.06916234,0.10108392,0.017911622,0.03564209,-0.024588613,0.086733945,0.12061012,-0.10467443,-0.07187733,-0.002478622,-0.017566577,-0.03113431,-0.08467319,-0.022011321,0.11943203,-0.026761416,0.07366932,-0.059880193,0.022312284,0.023684666,-0.01988214,-0.019487944,0.051203232,0.05186808,-0.099305324
"The largest moral principle by which I live my life is to do as little harm to others as possible. I believe the world and life, in general, are already very cruel. We cannot readily predict when we will encounter suffering and, more often than not, we cannot tell if another person is currently suffering. In my life, I feel I have experienced an exponential amount of suffering, more than everybody I know, so I understand what its like to suffer in silence. Due to the unpredictability of the things that hurt us in life, I prioritize not being something that hurts others. I try to be as kind and considerate as I kind. I go out of my way to help others and make them feel joy if I can. This spreads to most of my other philosophies as well.","From the 10th to the 13th, I had a very basic routine that I was following. I wake up at around 8:00 am and feed my cat. Then I eat, wash up and brush my teeth. Following this, I do a bit of online work and fulfill whatever basic tasks I have to do for that day. These include grocery shopping, Christmas gift shopping and other things. On the 14th I had my college graduation. I got up very early, got ready, attended, walked across the stage and after had lunch my with family. From then on, I repeated the same activities I performed from the 10th to the 13th. I go out probably every other day, typically for groceries. This morning, I made gingerbread cookies for Christmas and cooked a more elaborate breakfast for myself. I also prepared my living room, as people are coming over for a window problem.",4.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,1.5,1.1666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.1666666666666665,4.5,2.0,5.0,1.5,4.0,3.5,1.0,3.0,6.0,4.5,5,3.0,1.5,4.666666666666667,1,22,6,English,1,5,R_OliH9rLEHd9f1Kh,0.010688808,0.11093226,0.14542946,0.13205823,0.10889256,0.16321832,-0.012459693,0.09078269,0.15334813,0.05823888,0.0053121434,0.10939379,0.19295435,0.28206402,0.15707849,0.17930356,0.11261918,0.06217843,-0.018903006,-0.0037721656,0.060136277,-0.00942831,-0.028971318,0.02720246,0.011108311,0.06516417,0.11234319,0.008661644,0.023663899,0.0056013297,0.13965014,0.16534722,0.12996052,0.10059427,0.09295395,-0.00075170863,0.04938948,0.04466232,-0.01797822,-0.026578445,-0.0063437913,0.2533366,0.06878306,0.07575093,0.07291058,-0.07739163,0.03756953,-0.07155123,0.13557987,0.17916903,0.033870857,0.05031826,0.17513555,0.23603597,0.17431967,0.2938466,0.097769134,0.20960434,0.29479146,0.16810991,0.06818107,0.1069261,-0.04817744,-0.037941184,-0.09707782,0.024462909,-9.2454255e-05,-0.0046702093,-0.038289852,-0.0036325054,0.047063194,-0.044936202,0.046063457,0.024235683,0.022330608,-0.0070804544,-0.010232096,-0.0122757405,0.02113254,0.09470484,-0.06751966,-0.07646539,-0.08234617,-0.068817966,-0.019030176,-0.122639485,-0.027578728,0.19641908,0.062477387,0.06997739,-0.051784076,-0.018584795,-0.03888081,-0.0056238323,-0.103911854,0.032685682,-0.024830855,-0.072796464
"The most important values to me are to always treat people with respect and help when I can. I value my family and would do anything at all for my mom. Family time is important to me. My husband and I are working hard to keep our focus on living life rather than work each day. I believe in the golden rule, treat others and you would like to be treated. I think the right thing to do is always be polite and have a smile on your face. You never know when you could impact someone's day in a positive way.","This past week I have played tennis 3 times. I have to play at night because I work and study in the day time. I've been studying and practicing the stock market. I also work in real estate during the day. One day I had to drop my husband's car off for an oil change so he took my car to work that day. While it was there, it was found that he needed new brakes. That was a big expense for the week. Each night my husband and I had dinner together.

"My values include trying to be a good person, good parent and good worker.  I believe that my family relationship tops most other relationships such as my roles as girlfriend,  employee or friend.  I try to interact with all so that I feel blameless in my actions and communication knowing that I'm doing no harm and only want to help others for the most part.  While I do value others I believe that I need to preserve myself by setting boundaries with others because people may be well-meaning but will take and take until I'm left with nothing.",Well I work nights so I work from home at 7pm nightly and was off on Monday and will be off tomorrow.   Since I was off on Monday after I picked up my little one from school we went to visit the daycare where I used to work because they had a birthday jumpy and we were able to visit with friends a bit. Then we drove around and looked at the Christmas lights while listening to cheerful music and drank hot chocolate with tons of marshmallows. Tuesday was work and it was pouring rain so we watched Home Alone until work.  Wednesday we went to the gym and Thursday we went to the park until it got too chilly.,4.833333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.8333333333333335,3.5,3.333333333333333,3.0,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,5.0,3.5,6.0,3.5,5.5,2.0,5.0,5.5,4.5,4.5,21,2.333333333333333,1.5,4.0,1,46,1,English,2,6,R_AG5FYyvObpywtKp,0.025796771,-0.021914769,0.055809617,-0.014816209,0.10660685,0.09284587,-0.010126419,0.09442104,0.09219519,0.08616406,-0.047591187,-0.06845254,0.11640531,0.16093433,0.07215519,0.009220169,-0.024806669,0.031053822,-0.0517324,0.016921986,0.040364213,0.027796112,0.015256848,0.02344337,-0.028797623,0.0017571077,0.063710034,0.048507646,0.017510979,0.008038711,0.12690333,0.14701898,0.051358044,0.13974743,0.026711263,0.010978423,-0.010935308,-0.010731598,-0.05768471,-0.028852537,-0.025123324,0.18757395,0.03459238,-0.02667785,-0.026435012,-0.042208068,0.07859657,-0.011638099,0.019712947,0.03642284,0.011496294,0.010790044,0.19269083,0.09927832,0.086596794,0.12790643,0.08164002,-0.0009841099,0.23865221,0.07775549,0.11290639,0.011257777,-0.067750365,-0.062453195,-0.027140208,0.058255475,0.06707217,0.049342368,-0.036261085,-0.0034957044,-0.042198285,-0.06192667,0.050704077,0.022007316,0.007659247,-0.054233283,0.03773222,0.038635835,-0.010598948,0.12270144,-0.07660389,0.0003340384,-0.048682045,-0.05356578,0.003432013,-0.022097414,-0.07173872,0.07403968,-0.027534021,-0.036410246,-0.05587224,-0.08933075,-0.08283776,-0.055258997,-0.004069835,0.059790794,-0.08415978,-0.019164987
"I believe in being honest with people. Not about tiny stuff that will hurt their feelings but about the big issues. I believe in doing what I can to make the world better, in small ways (I am a teacher and used to be an environmental educator). I have no delusions of making a big difference but small kindnesses matter. I think it's important that we listen to each other with a degree of civility even when we disagree. It's important to be gentle and patient with the disabled, elderly, animals, and children. It's nice to be curious about the world and share that enjoyment with others but it's not essential. If you can't say something good, or know you are angry, keep your mouth shut so at least you don't hurt anyone. Try not to judge others because you don't know what their life has been like and there but for the grace of the universe- it could be you.",I have gone to neurofeedback appointments in Cambridge for my extreme depression and anxiety. It takes an hour to drive there because I'm too nervous to go on the big roads. The back roads are better. I've gone for several walks in the woods and also on the road with my mom. I have gone to CVS to pick up prescriptions. I've watched PBS mysteries with my mom and Gotham also on Netflix. I've been reading old Spenser novels. I do surveys on Mechanical Turk for maybe 20 min. per day. I walked to Whole Foods and around the city when I stayed in Cambridge and first quarantined here. We went to a friends and sat outside at their fire pit. We aren't going inside because of Covid and we have an immunocompromised family member. I went for a walk with my brother. I said hi to my dad and step mom at the farmstand.,3.8333333333333335,3.5,3.6666666666666665,1.8333333333333333,2.5,1.6666666666666667,3.333333333333333,3.8333333333333335,4.0,2.5,5.666666666666668,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,6,3.1666666666666665,1.5,3.333333333333333,1,51,6,English,1,5,R_24I8UjNfAfMPRQd,0.026997115,-0.02979925,0.1683017,0.04210048,0.17520635,0.14115104,0.069423094,0.18278015,0.13565992,0.08896853,0.049352996,0.0781479,0.16496086,0.18848072,0.14800279,0.1262371,0.058347635,0.06082607,0.037903145,0.06527969,0.030647378,0.091955334,-0.026638106,-0.04722933,-0.050231136,-0.025112573,0.046733398,0.11872213,0.040866725,-0.042698964,0.17093158,0.12922964,0.118263066,0.08957338,0.024863921,0.11555776,0.08762954,0.07775807,0.049015734,0.09698321,0.06637223,0.1040671,0.05971925,-0.0057785413,0.057552733,-0.016852815,0.1256946,0.12459168,0.08750905,0.05285172,0.19949192,0.23083548,0.12976073,0.16797964,0.14307097,0.18981168,0.051870592,0.11386177,0.24446736,0.05891939,0.20784083,0.03826303,0.16113672,0.048122488,0.14946231,0.27724734,0.21032976,0.105583996,-0.033482693,0.013738683,0.00016066805,-0.001062151,-0.0068616606,0.04879806,-0.038530238,-0.036187124,-0.040330462,0.043934353,-0.01198112,0.13427971,-0.09597771,-0.05460146,0.061852712,-0.058256187,-0.006033793,-0.10132937,-0.1035344,0.045443933,0.02411991,0.13631424,-0.03386733,-0.01940885,0.06399792,-0.009978605,0.03705302,0.17895365,0.15602773,-0.0826599
"I think I value good relationships, individual fulfillment/development, and social harmony. 
I think I value good interpersonal relationships over any other thing. I think I can live with myself if I don't achieve much personally if I have a good romantic relationship and good friendships. I don't feel obligated to be close to everyone that I'm ""supposed"" to, but I believe in finding people who you enjoy and who enjoy you and having a good time one this earth.","A week ago, I took my last final. I got up, ate breakfast, took a shower, did some last-minute studying, and took the final for three hours. This was a remote final, so I had to set up my space so that I would not be disturbed. I got out of the final, and me and my boyfriend got dinner. We went to Wendy's because it was a familiar drive, but I would have preferred to go somewhere local because I am visiting from out of state. 
Then, there were very serious tornado warnings. Tornados aren't really a concern where I was from, but this seemed very serious, so we hung out in the bathtub twice that night. We probably should have went somewhere on the first floor because we're on a second floor apartment, but we didn't really know where to go. The tornado just missed our area. 
For the rest of the week, my boyfriend had to continue studying. I should be applying to jobs, but I am beyond broke so I have been spending a lot of time on Mturk. I divide my time between mturk, cooking, and relaxing. Yesterday, I started to read American Gods on a whim. I'm not sure how good it is yet.",4.666666666666667,4.666666666666667,3.0,1.8333333333333333,2.0,1.6666666666666667,3.8333333333333335,3.333333333333333,6.0,3.0,6.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,5.0,16,2.833333333333333,2.5,3.1666666666666665,1,24,1,English,16,5,R_2yad4d9Sfs3oSiG,0.034786932,0.07033061,0.19562429,0.062017683,0.0005372185,0.07340874,0.011102015,0.16284549,0.06480317,0.03608611,-0.07415646,-0.011750878,0.091370955,0.17547864,0.13048166,0.12456721,0.098112546,0.04353901,0.060951173,0.09219602,0.078978315,0.015942603,0.013470571,0.06408064,0.09454586,0.023676127,0.07951291,0.03282218,0.05295948,-0.0064918315,0.1530061,0.14853951,0.17339636,0.01688528,0.078390256,0.033497956,0.06650159,0.042379063,-0.035734996,0.0025891755,-0.06593351,0.2131576,0.093784355,0.021363856,-0.04052841,-0.13548991,-0.029536875,0.11503348,-0.022042269,0.076493874,0.19805759,0.17304316,0.08832924,0.147735,0.0919418,0.11701347,0.051724564,0.045638256,0.2548757,0.013064746,0.0023186863,0.03749729,0.031233698,-0.0087139085,-0.0034356862,0.038779847,0.16135941,0.012743445,-0.026520899,-0.010739498,0.017426386,-0.014808351,-0.04038525,0.027782455,-0.0016430859,-0.1266323,-0.001709288,-0.11726274,-0.02610605,-0.023052976,-0.16881695,-0.12530516,-0.047633477,-0.039781816,-0.07305357,-0.10143595,-0.042228553,0.07106118,-0.031121336,0.04953833,-0.08201866,-0.077778235,0.015977032,0.022845447,-0.031770527,0.04779867,-0.054617602,-0.12526894

Most importantly doing what I know is the right thing to do, even if others are unaware.  I am not a religious person, so God is not coming after me.  But, knowingly doing something wrong is harmful to me.  So, I try to be true to myself.","We dined out at the Range on Saturday night.  It is a mediocre bistro.

"When think about central and important values in my life the first one I think of is humility. I know that all I have in life is a gift and I'm not entitled to anything. Another value is faith. Without faith in God you can do nothing. Also kindness is important. A little kindness goes a long ways. I am kind not because of how it might benefit me, but because I want to see the dignity of my fellow humans. Another value is generosity. I try to give at least half my income to charity every year.","This week I have watched a lot of football. Football begins on Saturday with college football. I typically watch my favorite team. Then Sunday is NFL football, while I don't cheer for a particular team I just enjoy football. Monday is Monday NIght Football which normally is an exciting and anticipated game. Also everyday I do the dished. I am responsible for filling and emptying the dishwasher everyday. Usually I get on M-Turk and try to get a little dough (money) from completing hits.

"My basic philosophy hasn't changed since I was a teen. It basically goes: family first, friends second and everything else is a distant third. I haven't been motivated by material things as much as many others, and making money was never a primary goal. I've tried to support my family as much as possible, and since I never wanted children of my own, this meant devoting time to my parents, siblings and nieces and nephews. Since so many have died before me now, it leaves me somewhat lost. In the last few years, I have added a new guide for my life, which is to leave something of myself that friends and family will remember. My writing has become more important to my self-image than I thought it could become.","The past week has been uneventful. I've done the usual chores around the house, including sweeping, moping and feeding the cats. Washing clothes and cleaning out my shop were also on the agenda. I did take one trip out of town, to go grocery shopping. That took four hours, altogether and was only notable for the number of large trucks on the road. I have spent a great deal of time online, watching Youtube videos and one streaming movie on Amazon Prime which wasn't worth my time. And I got the last of my Christmas shopping done.",3.333333333333333,3.0,2.1666666666666665,1.5,1.1666666666666667,1.0,3.6666666666666665,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,1.5,1.0,5.0,5,2.6666666666666665,1.5,3.5,2,63,6,English,1,5,R_3pipimacvQuzt8d,0.0030890126,0.025273792,0.12121934,0.105593055,0.054183464,0.2057215,0.057573806,0.12146099,0.11868446,0.10744514,-0.07893464,0.07091087,0.23857503,0.31470302,0.03312935,0.037041083,0.035730798,0.0005419543,-0.043982383,0.0026853904,0.019360024,0.013939238,-0.014199127,-0.0043499265,0.024739746,0.17080635,0.18423864,0.004041819,0.004343399,0.06786893,0.15235107,0.12731561,0.098377526,0.2242602,0.14330716,0.0077806003,0.09378423,0.061733857,-0.036791548,-0.024468835,0.00799858,0.2100027,0.09543817,0.12126066,0.086911194,0.013897149,0.038881607,0.019367356,0.08548951,0.17023358,0.0024202066,0.027755363,0.22078688,0.24170168,0.13428177,0.2397934,0.12794349,0.08652979,0.33008295,0.13270302,0.1887424,0.08864185,0.026838575,0.014966902,-0.0072856583,0.0597451,0.05140495,0.076933905,0.090682365,0.09663659,0.07996516,0.07271885,0.09610142,0.05377235,0.114288986,0.02091313,0.095269024,0.042182088,0.040287785,0.12565817,-0.13802646,-0.017889023,0.019962315,-0.08046362,-0.020322653,-0.109507196,0.02227127,0.19376072,0.028900228,0.020971399,-0.05578927,-0.031265285,-0.09428097,0.022146765,-0.035782762,0.021350104,-0.05606109,-0.055877253
"The most important values that guide my life are peace and security. I did not have a lot of security as a child and I want to feel secure as an adult, both in my relationships and financially. Another central value in my life is finding and developing a sense of peace. I am afraid of violence being done to me and seek to feel not afraid and at peace in my day to day life, and hope to help instill that feeling in other's as well. It is hard somedays to be patient at work and I tell myself to maintain my peace.",I have gone through the drive-thru of a place called Slim Chicken's. I have bought energy drinks and coffee at gas stations. I have smoked cigarettes. I have spent time with my dogs. I have worked every evening. I have eaten a left over enchilada that my sister didn't eat because I forgot to pick up dinner. I have spilled cheerios. I have scolded my dogs. I have fed the cats. I have done laundry. I have completed surveys on MTurk and attended classes with my client who has developmental challenges. I have made a christmas card. I have mailed a thank you card. I have made my own bed and other people's beds. I have asked my loved ones about their day. I have loaned money and called my mother. I have had money paid back to me. I have gone to ATM's and been caught in the rain long enough to be soaked. I have fueled up my car at gas stations and been 4 minutes late for work. I have aired up my tires and heard my ex introduce his new album on the radio.,4.666666666666667,2.833333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,2.5,3.5,3.8333333333333335,4.5,3.5,6.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.5,5.5,9,3.1666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,1,27,5,english,1,3,R_1NgIZfle0I5pVJ2,-0.04234669,0.009269336,0.13922912,0.052656554,-0.0535454,0.23060659,-0.0025839284,0.046723895,0.070552096,0.05524673,-0.030786637,0.057003394,0.014185157,0.056953963,0.06704494,0.1126471,0.12666142,0.010807746,0.0004012566,-0.072410636,-0.012491874,0.06832725,0.03335418,0.0124476645,-0.0042437245,0.08897864,0.06583261,0.074864514,-0.044916283,-0.072987445,0.101423845,0.11637622,0.08917238,0.025863655,-0.040907454,-0.10927879,-0.014459167,-0.08216479,-0.13103883,-0.09387983,-0.15184334,0.17959496,0.027445953,-0.019360866,0.054799877,-0.1522398,-0.0036764033,-0.043844156,-0.008233335,0.047809504,-0.028641582,-0.023221921,0.12964708,0.08675713,0.12336323,0.10555219,0.043063626,0.10890353,0.21572247,0.0260758,0.05294209,0.032308336,0.02236106,-0.0059010573,0.049809534,0.09384867,0.06408033,0.06887773,-0.031922065,-0.0615685,0.02875048,-0.07001682,0.0048185866,0.0640658,0.011152741,-0.02094902,0.007708529,-0.017728785,0.0041728076,0.049633443,-0.107176006,-0.10292825,-0.0443317,-0.07579041,-0.049225546,-0.06801801,-0.11989263,0.04106824,0.010942617,0.060309023,-0.046815634,-0.0898353,-0.08762626,-0.07877205,-0.08280564,-0.06166991,-0.06360984,-0.13058463
"My basic values of life are to be honest and to accept that those around me could be worse off and if they are to help them. I think it takes a village to live your life. Life is hard and you shouldn't do it alone. Also, being honest really just knocks all of my other basic life values out of the park. In order to compare those, you would have to be honest either with other or yourself.","On last Friday I was feeling a little under the weather. I did some HITs on MTurk, and browsed social media, but I pretty much rested all day while watching Netflix. I had to pick my sister in law up from work, then came home. I ate dinner with my boyfriend and then went to sleep. 
On Saturday I took a shower and gor dressed. I did my skincare routine and then I did my makeup. I relaxed in the house with my byofriend watching movies. We te lunch and then chilled the rest of the day until it was time for bed. We did our nightly routine and went to sleep.
Sunday we didnt do anything. We stayed in our pjs all day and chilled.
On Monday we did our weekly store tripe and laundry trip. We then did all of our errands, and chilled in the house watching movies all day.
On Tuesday we traveled to Michigan and came home. That took all day and all of our energy.
I dont really remember doing anything much different all of these other days. Woke up did everything already mentioned and did MTurks.",4.5,3.5,4.166666666666667,2.5,4.333333333333333,3.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,5.5,3.5,5.333333333333333,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,12,3.0,3.0,3.333333333333333,1,25,1,English,16,3,R_25A6B3V6zmI3P90,-0.03906649,-0.054758064,0.04148819,-0.0014440697,0.0035343291,0.071565345,-0.113718,-0.010534503,0.017742451,0.016501117,-0.09076996,-0.034778614,-0.045294024,0.07115461,0.04101882,-0.0019422239,-0.027148668,-0.05849318,-0.0021967515,0.021581516,-0.052652568,-0.015495658,-0.054233212,0.020687532,-0.017468927,0.027684769,0.034250792,0.014506858,-0.054480415,-0.03214727,0.0046068616,0.13297278,0.069568366,0.0022705253,0.046058126,-0.1431467,-0.098386146,-0.1072773,-0.13252647,-0.15119189,-0.17456135,0.15326384,0.016463885,-0.06955837,-0.07590465,-0.14272544,-0.086836785,-0.03970006,-0.054241035,-0.02916462,-0.029336683,-0.039386973,0.03236643,0.116123185,-0.040830195,0.063542515,-0.035868347,0.019843303,0.11717187,0.056393515,-0.053321354,0.0048132315,-0.05843063,-0.10129151,-0.031046458,-0.039572146,0.02466441,-0.058371052,-0.031466167,-0.06445409,-0.022970024,-0.09832689,-0.011085134,-0.050736915,-0.07477623,-0.10474047,-0.06685026,-0.12464683,-0.04795302,0.034311473,-0.20456886,-0.20216428,-0.094176434,-0.08873165,-0.06153761,-0.06426463,-0.13882492,0.00905663,-0.11309322,-0.036529712,-0.20016862,-0.11142252,-0.10248197,-0.09208106,-0.12988742,-0.037569366,-0.051121324,-0.1468022
"I stand my ground and am a very hard-headed person, I sometimes alienate myself because of this stubbornness. Over the years I have learned that I alone am all I can really count on all those that I have let into my life have failed me or left me due to stupid petty reasons. I lost friends over politics which is mainly them being naive and believing everything that is spoon-fed to them.
I am a trustworthy person I am fiercely protective of those I love and care for. I am honest and brutally honest as a matter of fact.  I find it hard to keep quiet when I see something that isn't right and while I am told to tone it down I just can't. It is not who I am.","the last 7 days I have been caring for a litter of 11 puppies who keep me up most nights and I am terrible protective of them just like their mother. I spend my days making sure they are warm, and clean and make sure mama is getting the care she needs to stay strong to keep up with them.
I work a lot more from my computer these days trying to make every dime that I can to help my family make ends meet.

"One of my most central values is treating others with kindness. Wherever I go, and whomever I approach, I try to be as kind as possible because you never really know what a person is going through. When I go shopping or interact with employees, I don't want to be an annoying customer, especially when they have to interact with so many people on a daily basis during a pandemic. One of my other most important guiding values is trying to be empathetic. Putting yourself into another person's shoes is key in trying to understanding them.","Last Saturday we went to a music festival that required vaccinations or a negative covid test to get in. It was a lot of fun but it was freezing, and we waited for nearly 30 minutes to get on a bus to take us to the parking lot that was a few miles away. The next day I did two loads of laundry. I put some of these clothes in the dryer, and I hung some on hangers to dry outside. While I was waiting for them to dry. In the afternoon I took the clothes back inside and folded them. Every day I started work in the morning, and then went on mTurk afterward to complete some studies and surveys. I would help prepare for dinner and then did the dishes after we finished eating. I will check my emails and sort through them, and delete the unnecessary ones. On Wednesday I hung out with my boyfriend. We had dinner and watched a few basketball games.

Being selfless and thinking about others is a big important part of what I value. In the times we live in its easy to not even consider other people or what your actions can do to them so always keeping that perspective in mind is really important. I have lost friends and made friends following this mindset and it showed me the people that I want to keep around and those that I don't. I also consider the affects that my actions will have on society and the planet. These are fundamental things we must keep healthy and thriving in order to survive.,"Last week I was christmas shopping and visiting friends and family during their respective holiday breaks. It was some mundane activities like shopping, checking out at the store, and lunches but it was a very nice experience seeing those I haven't been able to see much. The following sunday and saturday were spent watching sports and enjoying time at home with my girlfriend and cats. Those are how I like spending my weekends. During the week I mostly filled out surveys and searched for jobs, this also included taking breaks to game or drum and clear my mind overall.",3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,3.5,2.6666666666666665,2.833333333333333,2.333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665,6.0,5.5,6.0,3.5,5.5,4.0,6.0,4.5,4.5,6.0,6,3.0,3.0,3.8333333333333335,2,34,6,english,1,3,R_2pLeBCKufemuplb,0.047388554,0.011869721,0.124669746,0.09496701,0.09961113,0.24398114,0.02268552,0.08928098,0.17515369,0.13224927,-0.03650046,0.07075232,0.31956732,0.42827109,0.1341938,0.08412756,0.06832698,-0.03373097,-0.036420643,0.019417666,0.08047898,0.11806367,-0.05022666,0.06581344,0.05640451,0.10682981,0.19439384,0.011812702,0.02016082,0.018820597,0.16060297,0.20755762,0.11752676,0.25224862,0.12709616,0.028187117,0.004111237,0.05673196,-0.015533749,-0.025967214,0.0049354834,0.2634789,0.10792386,0.16871172,0.110116795,-0.031158134,0.09958772,0.012919485,0.16568694,0.16818042,0.09676425,0.04907464,0.2769675,0.31712908,0.11185427,0.17996708,0.09985067,0.13175122,0.3747217,0.24181876,0.26270545,0.13202472,0.044280972,-0.00565692,-0.035608165,0.071377695,-0.0002228748,0.08191928,0.066926345,0.08195306,0.050396208,0.094163224,0.06719296,0.0643629,0.08689737,0.009364262,0.08279511,0.100873075,0.019188005,0.19505695,-0.1618062,-0.038330548,0.023191696,-0.13740104,-0.019501772,-0.014212486,0.050797693,0.18011807,0.0047018733,0.01911693,-0.11611871,-0.08971422,-0.065399446,0.043313343,-0.04828338,0.12345666,-0.08875871,0.038490828
"One of my most important values is that of family and unity. Family is very important to me and plays a role in everything that I do and how I act no matter the group that I am around. Even decisions that I make as an individual and for myself reflect in some way how it would be for my family. It also affects all of my life goals. All my short and long term goals surround me but also how it will affect my family. Another value that is central to my life would be how I view relationships and marriage. I have very traditions views on family and relationships and this greatly affects how I interact with and act as a wife and what I looked for in a husband. Others who do not agree, understand my views and if different we all respect one another but our household does run differently compared to other people our age and other married friends that we have.",A week ago today I was getting the house cleaned and perfect for my Childs first birthday party. I spent the entire day cleaning and making sure the house was as tidy and clean as could be for the party. The next few days after that consisted of making food for the party and making and decorating a homemade cake. I also spent more time cleaning. I did spend time opening Christmas gifts early with some friends who we would not see closer to Christmas. I then had my childs birthday party and had family and friends at our house and spent the day hosting and making sure everyone had enough food and drink. We also opened more presents. The next few days after and up until today was spent cleaning up after the party and getting the house back into order.,4.666666666666667,4.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,2.5,2.6666666666666665,2.833333333333333,3.8333333333333335,4.5,3.5,6.0,4.0,5.5,4.5,4.5,6.0,4.0,6.0,25,3.333333333333333,5.0,3.0,1,28,1,English,1,6,R_5aQRNj2HAIVhvwJ,-0.015174997,0.010524558,0.099960186,0.041795295,0.08894902,0.119927295,0.032332193,0.075864196,0.056863796,0.063218236,-0.07444509,-0.020025529,0.080158606,0.1408481,0.016651865,0.088965595,0.015262086,0.054224685,-0.06448844,-0.04889226,0.041728966,-0.033777963,0.014920514,0.02818834,-0.037284087,0.16603564,0.07147548,0.05085151,-0.049826615,-0.055472407,0.09068599,0.09738918,0.015919032,0.04672537,-0.04345672,-0.07140854,0.022611242,0.0032963715,-0.10247803,-0.039752007,-0.05454589,0.18271497,0.048778262,-0.018166944,0.045389794,-0.012481691,-0.048107885,-0.040539976,-0.027498921,0.06204552,-0.028625648,-0.016737767,0.20152906,0.08448896,0.12781751,0.19620962,0.07831904,0.08501658,0.20531301,0.057989713,0.051837757,0.06741153,-0.06305824,-0.06822987,-0.035096504,0.0009200834,0.026486313,0.003148093,0.05035003,-0.0015025511,0.046434246,-0.02136483,0.04109177,-0.006755417,-0.01175585,0.00083726645,-0.01787965,-0.04662538,-0.024831783,0.08748703,-0.020348713,-0.06107983,-0.046971932,-0.052913357,0.021211874,-0.08669212,-0.051315553,0.19434643,0.12496126,-0.011435071,0.0005812384,-0.0038929088,-0.032367926,0.030419633,-0.103129104,-0.007846598,-0.05586829,-0.01469264
"Some values that guide my life are kindness (treating others how I want to be treated), patience, being myself, and staying curious. I personally think there isn't really any deeper meaning to life than to live, because I think once we die that's it, the lights go out, no afterlife, so I kind of embrace the ridiculousness of it all and live for myself too. I try not to let work rule my life too much and try to learn, and experience everything. I also value the importance of relationships.","This past week, I have been working long days from 7-4 or 11-8. Because this takes up much of my day, I don't have much time or energy to do other things. In the morning I try to do yoga or some exercise before work and when I get home I cook a meal and take a shower. On my days off I try to get things done, like laundry, dishes, or meal prep, and when I can I might spend the day in bed or on the couch playing video games. On those days off I try to get in touch with my family too. I took the week off from lifting weights but when I do, I train 6 days a week.",4.0,2.5,2.6666666666666665,1.8333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.1666666666666667,4.0,3.6666666666666665,5.0,2.5,5.0,3.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.0,5.0,4.0,5,3.0,3.5,3.0,1,23,6,English,1,5,R_3GlH59WLUzAuubW,-0.09632659,-0.030846685,0.0013300274,0.010827739,0.051050935,0.118608996,-0.087500565,-0.089402884,0.02478146,-0.0078839455,-0.029487051,0.00073209405,0.07098777,0.13460201,0.043984223,0.067325115,0.07269302,-0.06675287,-0.021262817,-0.021863498,0.023440294,-0.0039312933,-0.083438985,-0.047548257,-0.07704401,-0.030618625,-0.027797531,0.016487692,-0.005140718,-0.007903609,-0.017298829,0.09510906,0.068953395,0.010743344,0.086599804,-0.08350949,-0.11270018,-0.098023415,-0.09073532,-0.108530656,-0.08824369,0.06250776,-0.008890688,-0.0815777,-0.07596653,-0.115635954,-0.068960205,-0.11449359,-0.0010720044,-0.025506895,-0.14090958,-0.08082058,-0.04425756,0.07490575,0.020564782,0.0815756,-0.068681985,0.08493719,0.021081392,0.05367782,0.010445219,-0.0011985581,-0.16665693,-0.13202043,-0.10729792,-0.111701526,-0.05888848,-0.02409679,-0.068072334,-0.06590177,0.058462538,-0.11915494,0.09174542,-0.018693352,0.026383143,-0.0068153664,0.062727876,-0.09731321,-0.022837065,0.011468267,-0.04088875,-0.06784538,-0.13550794,0.045234516,-0.031128932,-0.0075816475,-0.15088138,-0.000742821,-0.049198702,0.0068515465,-0.14062081,-0.09710668,-0.053971175,-0.14814395,-0.09123641,-0.063764155,-0.036903694,-0.1599859
"My central values are mostly caring for people and being and honest and being moral. Caring for people is a huge part of what I do in my life and especially more now that I am married. I am constantly looking out for people and trying to help them and pushing them forward and up. Being honest is a huge part of my life as well. You can not build or have relationships without trust. Trust is a huge part of everyday life and allows people to grow close with you. Having morals and being moral is a huge part of life as well. It can guide you down the wrong path and not having good values and morals can really take you down the wrong path so it is important to keep your head on strait and keep moving forward in life. Helping other, helping yourself, being kind to strangers and having a helping hand whenever necessary. I follow sports and a lot of athletes try and set good examples.","Last Friday me and my  wife went on a date to a Mexican restaurant and then we went to the movies after that. We saw a new movie that had just came out and after that went home and went to bed. Saturday we hung out at home all day and made lots of food and watched a lot of movies at our house which we don't normally do. We did that all day and wrapped some presents. Sunday we watched football mostly all day and then watch the show succession until we went to bed and kind of just relaxed because we had work the next day. Monday we both went to work and then got chipotle for dinner after we had gotten off work and took that home and ate it, watched tv, and went to bed. Tuesday we worked during the day and then went to a Mexican restaurant for taco Tuesday. We ate there and then went home and went to bed. Wednesday we went to work during the day and then got teriyaki chicken for dinner, ate that, watch tv and went to bed.",4.0,3.333333333333333,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.166666666666667,4.0,4.5,4.666666666666667,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,14,3.5,5.0,3.333333333333333,2,30,1,English,1,5,R_2coQ2KKY35C0fJ9,0.019934738,0.018997882,0.07806083,0.03360818,0.015398841,0.10089256,-0.014079571,0.04231453,0.07020642,0.10234246,-0.09245602,-0.0065348595,0.11688995,0.1820699,0.06811808,0.0066903066,0.016485421,-0.032834977,-0.067907825,0.023658108,-0.014193643,-0.007460635,-0.028739255,0.20267712,0.04677263,0.033981096,0.09463454,0.06913064,-0.05900597,-0.011801256,0.123019055,0.199188,0.05384603,0.08677978,0.032917745,-0.024442391,0.019655954,0.05823566,-0.02742162,-0.04171543,-0.02894836,0.21049178,0.08305621,-0.015888834,0.014378954,-0.09482413,-0.014065571,-0.014442358,-0.0028523672,0.07118098,-0.015279524,-0.035934344,0.18358189,0.14124897,0.020421036,0.13097543,0.034139656,0.08540133,0.27771598,0.1340766,0.02324427,0.035976868,-0.05472338,-0.07195503,-0.025994085,-0.031085305,0.045059,0.032453053,-0.030365562,-0.02088828,-0.03771421,-0.06444321,0.076488495,0.018803714,-0.008929036,-0.061766535,-0.04273323,-0.011206113,-0.013307862,0.17154518,-0.12137063,-0.06929425,-0.03559138,-0.024288869,-0.010509395,-0.04173671,-0.023322765,0.13170303,-0.09771638,0.048335593,-0.123811275,-0.09957899,-0.069923915,-0.0055640778,-0.02645218,0.037844323,-0.074792884,0.05822553
The intrinsic value that I try to guide my life by is love. I try to filter everything I do through love. I also try to stay in each moment as it passes without living in past events or worrying about the future.,"I started making plans to have gastric surgery last week. I wrote a message to my doctor asking for a referral. While waiting for the referral, I did my usual daily thing. I took my dog for a walk for three of those days. I cleaned my house.

"The most important values I have are honesty and empathy.  I feel that people deserve to be told the truth, so they can trust you.  I know this hasn't been the case with other people and it's a trait I really value.  Empathy for others is so important because life is not always easy and you need people out there who will try to understand what you are going through and support you.  I have needed to have empathy for others in my life and appreciate those who have shown it to me.  It makes you feel like you're not alone in the world.","My week started out with the one day my husband was home from work after a very stressful week.  We got up and decided to go to our neighborhoods first craft's fair.  It was nice to just be able to walk to it.  There were food trucks there as well.  Afterward, my husband did some errands while I stayed at home.  I also did my chores, like washing clothes.  My dog was sick, so I had to take care of him too.  As the week went on, I did my regular chores and did exercises, including yoga and pilates.  I also did indoor cycling which I don't do often.

"Some of the most important values I have are honesty, kindness, and to be humble. 
I believe being honest is so important, I feel so guilty even thinking about having to sugar coat or fib anything the slightest. As a kid I remember I could not even sneak into the movies when my friends would. I always had the worst self conscience about doing anything that resulted in my not being honest. 
I also believe in being kind, even when other people are at their worst. You truly never know what someone else is going through, so kill them with kindness!
I've always been a very humble and modest person, because once again, you never know what someone else is going through, and its better to just go with the flow than to rock the boat... even when you know better. I truly feel that it is better to be modest and take things with a grain of salt rather than start conflict. You will always know the truth and know better, so its better to just go with things than upset someone else.","Last friday (1 week ago) we went to my husbands work christmas party. We went to a lounge in Los Angeles called La mer. The following day we started putting up our Christmas lights. Sunday was my dads 65th birthday and we took him out to lunch at a steak house near us. After lunch we did a little bit of shopping and then did birthday dessert with him. Monday I woke up at 5am, did my normal 45 minute Peloton ride and 30 minutes of strength workout classes. Tuesday and wednesday I'm combining because both of my children were home sick so those two days are a combined blur. Thursday I woke at 5am and started my normal routine... working out, breakfast getting my child ready for school, then taking her to school and spending time with my toddler. Today is friday, I woke up worked out for about an hour then started my day. I will pick my child up from school bring her home to start her Christmas vacation, and then go work 6 hours in urgent care tonight.

"I've come to live life in passive mode. Once you've begun to realize that you aren't the main character in life, and that everyone is suffering like you are, then you're more likely to be peaceful and leave others alone. I'm nonconfrontational, mostly for the sake of those around me. I do tend to feel like a territorial animal, and have problems with breaching of my personal space. Without trying to be calm and collected, I'd reveal I'm someone with anger issues and social anxiety. It's taken a lot to get over myself. I don't believe in hurting other people, but have instincts in my head that make me wary.","I've been playing a lot of video games at home. I like games with heavy story content. I really like letting my mind escape into another world. 
I have a few fish tanks, and I've been taking extra care of them recently. They're planted aquariums. Really lush jungles. The inhabitants look happy and engaged in their environment. I try to give them as close to an experience as I can to what they would get in the wild. I wish I could ask them what they think about living there.
I've really tried to step it up for the past few weeks with heathy cooking and working out. I've always been lean but wish to look more defined as I had been in the past. My child is nearing a year old and has become more mobile, climbing me and engaging in wrestling matches. I don't want to let her down by being inactive.",5.0,4.5,2.5,1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,4.0,3.8333333333333335,4.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,5.0,5,2.833333333333333,2.5,3.5,1,32,6,English,1,2,R_1Lwk2mtYY8BQw8n,0.15516056,0.22285438,0.29579556,0.16612872,0.18240194,0.26442695,0.16325794,0.101261824,0.1998951,0.14007263,0.04133866,0.2687678,0.06273231,0.21270482,0.12959829,0.19673657,0.14984779,0.028789544,0.001223065,0.043731913,0.1002592,0.025527898,-0.0063583534,0.08214772,0.17000896,-0.006913891,0.024774145,0.08515671,0.14847618,-0.008129101,0.23741321,0.22235273,0.22441852,0.10518849,0.13596012,0.10206138,0.15821932,0.14647177,0.13325518,0.053030446,0.08662179,0.26387918,0.20495354,0.1236491,0.17715569,0.08505644,0.11876276,0.2772591,0.28559324,0.23135257,0.27721402,0.09622005,0.13756825,0.3979196,0.18936981,0.19361317,0.21303204,0.27384013,0.21055636,0.18695626,0.17744835,0.20497517,0.1738903,0.14199726,0.08684532,0.20033225,0.12629116,0.12927528,0.052332077,-0.06314023,0.13172926,0.087277815,0.057622857,-0.0012966478,-0.009895623,0.023401238,-0.027969662,0.06425537,0.14207494,0.0626544,0.20408385,0.016302159,0.18511146,0.037768513,0.16284049,0.12133565,0.15637812,0.20538907,0.23692188,0.12444277,0.25602314,0.11670146,0.15915328,0.033260927,-0.028419517,0.10668961,0.054498926,0.06836763

no man can serve two masters. you have to have the courage of your convictions.
nature is important to all living things. everyone should work together to keep the planet clean. even the youngest person can do their part.
keeping things simple is the best way to live",this week i had many paperwork tasks to do and a lot of cleaning up and paper shredding. it is quite boring so i took a lot of breaks to do things like vaucum and read the newspaper. i also did a lot of cooking with plenty of leftovers to bring to work for lunch. this saves a lot of work as well as a lot of money. i had to work overtime two days this week. it always sets me behind in my errands when that happens.

"My most important values are respect and kindness to other people and to live with what feels right and most congruent to me. I interact with others with as little judgment as I can, though I know I am human and that is sometimes unavoidable. I am very careful about those I choose to keep around me and have a very close inner circle of fewer people. I have worked hard to stop my habit of people-pleasing and learned a lot about my own worth and what others are going through. I hope to touch many lives in my lifetime and I believe that that starts by focusing on kindness","I do many normal everyday activities, from getting ready in the morning for work, feeding and taking care of my cats and getting myself to work, usually with time to spare. I like to be early to work and have a nice, slow start to my day with plenty of time to get ready for anything that comes. At work I interact with many people and always do the best that I can. I work in healthcare and know that many people need a smile during their day and may not get it elsewhere. I take a short lunch to give my brain a break from work and eat a meal. I usually check in with my significant other at this time. I work again through the evening hours, and drive home to have a meal with my partner. We make it a priority to cook at home and eat a homemade meal as often as we can. We relax together with our cats during the evening. I take this time to check in with family too, since I live a thousand miles from my parents and prioritize checking in with them, and more times than not, that is a normal day for me.",3.8333333333333335,2.5,3.333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,2.333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,3.8333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,5.5,4.5,5.666666666666668,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,2.5,4.0,5.0,5,2.833333333333333,2.0,2.833333333333333,1,28,6,English,1,7,R_u7E57xsCR76f0Sl,0.12690043,0.17549555,0.29923007,0.22609268,0.15118685,0.22709998,0.16175315,0.12758875,0.22709537,0.14742073,0.025380984,0.21837842,0.2965597,0.39589277,0.1694384,0.14301062,0.13540955,-0.0023024331,-0.045238163,0.047763854,0.055289544,0.06249025,0.049985453,0.2190841,0.124461256,0.12106798,0.13222726,0.11738852,0.051079858,0.07591751,0.30046427,0.19004513,0.15164563,0.21720088,0.17933252,0.04710117,0.13446674,0.101107046,0.08253159,-0.0053477734,0.08844672,0.28336227,0.29159728,0.23681873,0.22112285,0.071860075,0.1023923,0.13885175,0.18352316,0.3040056,0.22526816,0.1762859,0.14520206,0.26772794,0.19000441,0.35404724,0.20662567,0.2499744,0.3899532,0.2708334,0.20979452,0.26712847,0.09974628,0.088480905,0.032707334,0.052361723,0.08661692,0.15018146,0.012267538,0.0921109,0.1535738,0.100676894,0.15084268,0.0530559,0.1341835,0.01913149,0.037507154,0.08407493,0.14158985,0.19075796,-0.039551843,-0.03534794,0.048529238,-0.063567944,0.0030938964,-0.0007755421,0.12579758,0.2441802,0.18574946,0.06941048,0.034151703,0.09593874,-0.0011226013,0.12367926,-0.058899537,0.0886754,-0.008342067,0.08842561
"I think it is important to put yourself first for all of the actions and decisions you make throughout your life - but it is also important to keep others in mind and not harm others to benefit yourself. I am not religious and do not believe in a God or a higher being that dictates what we can do and what is ""moral"". I think it's important to be nice to everyone and assume that they are also kind and trusting unless they prove you otherwise. However, it's important to not be too trusting and trust your gut. I think it's important to work hard for what you want in your life - nothing is just handed to you in life.","I worked from home every weekday in the past 7 days. I spent my lunch breaks at the gym doing strength training, cardio, and stretching. I had coffee and fruit for breakfast every morning, made eggs and toast for lunch, and mixed up what I made for dinner. I hung out with my boyfriend two nights of the week. We went out to dinner and got sushi one night.

"My most important values that guided my life were practically non-existent before I became a mother. I really didn't feel any obligation to help anyone else, and I always have been guided by my value of loyalty to those close to you, but I've often been let down by others in that same value. After I became a mother, though, I'm guided by many important values. Patience is a huge one. My son has autism and I have gained huge patience and understanding in parenting him. He's taught me so many things. I am guided by love for him.","Over the last week my activities included going shopping for groceries, working, communicating with friends and family, and caring for my son. I have been getting up at 7 in the morning and I pack his lunch, then wake up him up to take him to ABA therapy.

I always try to be friendly and polite to every person that I come in contact with. I treat everyone how I would want to be treated in every situation that I am in. My core values are respect. I think that respect is the most important thing. I try not being selfish and to always look at the bigger picture.,"For the past week I have done small tasks around the house like laundry and cleaning. I have made breakfast, lunch and dinner each day. I have also cleaned my yard and picked up after my dog in the backyard. I had family over for dinner and made tacos, everyone loved them. I also went grocery shopping and did some window shopping as well. It has been awfully cold and my husband and me built a farmhouse style fireplace cover to help with the draft.

"My most central values revolve around kindness and survival. My childhood was really rough; I came from a house where I was abused in every way, and I witnessed an insane amount of domestic violence, crime, pain, and mistreatment. I decided early on that I was going to live a GOOD life — I was going to survive this, get out, and be happy. Aside from a huge amount of PTSD, I have mostly managed it — in the simplest terms, I formed my values by just doing the exact opposite of EVERYTHING that was modeled to me in my childhood, but more expansively, I’ve focused on happiness and kindness. I treat people the way I want to be treated (kindness), unless they treat me badly, and then I draw a hard boundary and I simply refuse to have anything to do with them (survival.) Obviously there are exceptions — coworkers that I cannot simply avoid, things like that — but by entering the world with both kindness and boundaries, I’ve been able to navigate most things successfully. I have struggles and hard days, but the gradual curve of my life has been upward since I left home, which is a huge deal — statistically, women from backgrounds like mine often recreate them, falling victim to domestic violence, addiction, murder, or suicide in adulthood, and Im living a life NOTHING like that. The other thing that has been a powerful force in defining my values (and I’m treating my PTSD) has been Buddhism — simple states, trying my best to stay in the now as much as possible.","A week ago — last Thursday — I was in bed ALL day because I was recovering from a really bad sinus infection and the antibiotics hadn’t quite caught up yet. I was congested and sore and miserable. Friday was the same way. On Saturday the antibiotics caught up and I was able to get out of bed, which was great — we have children who are only half way through their vaccinations, so we’re still staying home and safe most of the time, so we spent Saturday and Sunday hanging out, playing board games, watching movies, cleaning, and relaxing. I also spent a lot of time unpacking our last boxes — we moved here to a new house a couple of months ago and I’m still unpacking the last handful of random small boxes. Monday I did homeschool with my kids while my husband worked from our home office; that was the same thing we every weekday this week.

"The values I hold in my life that are central, especially in raising children, are those of honesty and putting your best foot forward at all times. I don't care if my children struggle with school, grades, etc. I simply want to know that they are being honest about doing their homework and trying their hardest to make the grade. I want them to tell me if they have been in trouble or done something wrong before I find out from someone else. I try and model these behaviors but I also try to model being humble and admitting when we fall short. I don't always do my best and sometimes we are just tired and overwhelmed. I want to be able to be honest about that and I want them to too.","Over the past 7 days we have done quite a bit as a family. We got our Christmas decorations out of the garage and put up our tree. We did some other decorating. We started our Elf on the Shelf adventure for the youngest child. The older two helping make sure the Elf moves each night before we go to bed after the youngest is asleep. We have made homemade Chicken noodle soup, the kid's Grandmother's recipe and have had supper at home the last week. We have been to a town three hours away for my oldest daughter's Senior Year State Cheerleading competition. We sent gifts with our Oldest Navy Son's girlfriend who was here for a visit for Christmas and his Birthday.

"The most important values to me are integrity and honesty. Being honest with others and as well as their honesty with me is something I hold in high regard honesty and integrity.  Integrity to me is doing the right thing, especially when no one is watching. I feel it is very important and a way to walk a straight and moral path. Without honesty and integrity people would do whatever they want and hurt a lot of people in the process. Being honest is and always will be the most important thing to me. I believe in being myself, whether another person likes it or not. I am honest with them and honest with myself. I also believe in forgiveness. Forgiving another for the wrongs they have done allows us to get rid of the bad feelings they have given us. I may never forget what they did, but forgiving them allows me to move on.","For the last 7 days I have gone to work 4 times. I have done a few loads of laundry, cleaned my house and kept my kitchen and bathrooms clean. I have work on MTurk about an hour each day. I have enjoyed watching several old Christmas movies this past week. I finished wrapping my gifts and they are now under my Christmas tree,  Of course I have done a lot of cooking too. I have cooked dinner each night although a couple of times it was just left overs. I did some grocery shopping earlier this week and got the rest of the supplies I needed to make Christmas cookies. On Wednesday I made peanut butter and chocolat pecan fudge. It's delicious! I have watched the news each evening, both local and natioinal. Last weekend I watched the Army-Navy football game and was excited to see that CBS was going to show Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman. I have always enjoyed watching them. I have a Paramount plus subscription through Prime video and was extremely disappointed that CBS would not allow me to watch it. I was pretty angry so I sent an email to them to let them I was cancelling their service because of this. I pay for their service every month and felt it was pretty unfair that they blocked these shows.

"My most important value is FREEDOM. There are many ways to look at freedom, and the most important of these for me is the physical ability to relocate away from a place that I do not want to be. 
That's why I thought my world had ended when states began mandating that, as the price of transportation, I surrender the ability to get up from a seat for the duration of my time in a car (with the Damoclean sword of maybe not getting it back after the duration). this  has been followed by surrendering the right to even adjust the degree of my confinement. Now, even the decision to get out of the car can't be made without the permission of the car itself.
This has blossomed into an acute awareness of how deeply Government entwines itself into people's lives for the benefit of a select elite with no recourse for the ""working stiffs""","I spend most of most afternoons dealing with email and working HITs like this. At night, there are a few TV shows I follow, otherwise, I usually write (with ""writing breaks"" to play Age of Emipres). last night, I did some unplanned cleaning because the power went out in the morning and my desktop has a wonky power button. I unscrewed the case by touch before I figured out I only needed to take the screws on one side to open the panel. I found the wires, but the went to a connector red and black together and came out red-red and black-black, so I couldn't figure out which one s led to the ""start"" points on the board. Fortunately, my poking around must have been enough, because I bopped the start button and it booted.

"My central values are pretty strict when it comes to other people being in my life. I am extremely untrusting of a person, and it takes a LONG time for someone to integrate into my life. I do not like people who are drama queens, who ""put on a show"" in their introduction to me, or people who are loud and annoying. If anyone fits into this criterion usually, I do not give them the time of day. I would rather have no friends than any fake friends who annoy the hell out of me.","I had the unfortunate task of going to my dentist, I had a wisdom tooth break through and destroy my jaw from the inside. They prescribed me antibiotics so that the swelling went down, and then I had to get fillings done as well. The pain was unimaginable to be previously, and I had to take pain reliever all day and night to cope. It was literally the worst week I have ever had, and that's saying something because my life in the past has been shit.

My most important value I have is my ability to dismiss people who do not give me respect. It sounds stupid but it's a really important part of who I am. I've had people in the past try to take advantage of my good will and it ended up hurting me in a lot of different ways. So I don't stand up to it anymore.,"Most of my time is devoted these days to job applications and working on Mturk.

"The most important value to me is to help. To help someone mentally, emotionally, and/or physically. Life is difficult, but it becomes harder when people hoard the wealth and refuse to reach out to the bottom crowd. I always try to help family, friends, and strangers whenever I am able to. And I hope that one day in my life, someone will do the same for me. Another value of mine, though, is to be critical. To analyze everything so that I can make the correct choice based on logic and reason.","On Friday, My boyfriend, my friend, and I went to Little Tokyo to hang out and get ready for our nighttime event, which was a cool Arcane live immersive experience. We took some time to put our costumes on, and then headed for the destination. We were all nervous and excited about this new experience.  The following day, my friend went to the airport. My boyfriend and I spent Saturday and Sunday in Little Tokyo and ate a lot of ramen. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were mundane, we just stayed in the house and watched my son while my ex worked. Wednesday, my boyfriend left out of state and back home. Thursday, I did some online work and relaxed since I am on school break. And today, it's a early morning, so I'm still going through my day.",5.0,2.333333333333333,4.0,2.5,2.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,3.5,5.666666666666668,6.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,5.5,5.0,5,3.333333333333333,2.0,4.166666666666667,1,27,6,English,12,4,R_31RhWKo0Qimnk6s,0.11221209,0.022723116,0.14370534,-0.01333885,0.07936788,0.081170894,-0.0116129145,0.10976629,0.061325632,0.052722372,-0.09609303,-0.10786684,0.12123646,0.20152164,0.11288436,0.016956681,0.053853653,0.011035576,-0.062056743,0.051476456,0.047386516,-0.08865294,0.005215196,0.09440074,0.025942553,-0.0006185556,0.05839902,0.017777346,-0.015437321,-0.024745252,0.12101732,0.21578048,0.083097175,0.04027079,0.05268232,0.012003233,0.0116366455,0.0604264,-0.04328194,0.01194171,-0.020138018,0.2367225,0.09665363,-0.061426837,0.068953045,-0.09490171,-0.029113293,0.010170648,0.024858158,0.025121273,0.061087467,0.011557799,0.1480911,0.12263973,0.15615907,0.1280292,0.068471536,0.06286054,0.30565542,0.11344571,0.032079898,0.116095126,-0.051936492,-0.08662228,0.0033362955,0.03039863,0.121201575,0.092436865,-0.05455108,-0.08160477,-0.017128302,-0.0787199,0.026903778,-0.0065855477,-0.04897704,-0.07022102,-0.06634531,-0.019262446,-0.0511655,0.09097563,-0.08660705,-0.021805808,0.004763984,-0.028697949,0.08530314,-0.07256816,-0.036451183,0.13644186,0.05076725,0.04254542,-0.055000745,-0.10124725,0.03801876,0.024295725,0.049314454,0.123881154,-0.06523627,0.030479651

Working towards a better me and ignoring the naysayers.,This week I visited my sister. We had fun at her house. We had drinks with her boyfriend and friend. I had to shovel this week. It wasn't so bad. I had to go to the dentist for a root canal. Work was super busy this week most likely due to the holidays. I started on my Christmas shopping and wrapping.

"I live by the rule of 3, I believe that everything you put out into the universe you get back times 3. I believe that the energy in which you ut out is what you can expect to get back. think positive and positive things will happen, thing negatively and negative happens. I try to live every day of my life with this in my mind. I am really big on not putting out bad cause I don't want to get it back. I had a very tough life and struggled throughout most of it, once adopted this way of thinking and my life has changed for the better. I manifest the things I want from life and it happens. I use the universe to my benefit as it should be done. The universe provides us with everything that we need and we just need to learn to ask for it and believe it's already yours","I have not really done much, I made some candles for the upcoming event I have in January.

"Hard work is probably my central and most important values. Not much in life will be handed to you. So, if you want to have a good prosperous life it is important that you work hard. 
Also things earned are far greater than things handed to you. when you earn things no one has control over you or it and no one can take it away.",Life has been absolutly insane. I can't do what I want to do because I am waiting to close on a house. Also my car is not the greatest because I can pay to fix it completly and I can't get a new one untill I close on the house. Because it will mess up the closeing process. Sooo I have been stressing Out tremedsly. Everyday feels the same. I wake up get ready for work. Then build up the confidnece to drive to work. I am so scared its going to break down on me and I am going to get in a horrible car accident. Then I drive super caughtly to work. So far I've made it everyday. Then I work for 8 hours. My jobs pretty cool. So its cool. Then I cautiously drive home. I do nothing esle unless I can get a ride there and back. I really hope I can close soon.

"I suppose I have to start with the fact that I'm a liberal.  So, my core and basic values inevitably come back to that.  Think about your typical bleeding-heart liberal, and that's me.  Abortion has been in the news again (for some reason) and that just turns my stomach that we're even discussing it anymore.  A woman's body is hers to do with what she wants.  I believe in family, despite my shrinking one.  I believe in the American justice system, as flawed as it is.  I am for helping the poor and taxing the rich.  I am for affordable college, affordable groceries, and not tempting people to trample each other on black Friday.  I am definitely concerned about our environment and what we're collectively doing to this planet.  I try to do my part to the best of my abilities, but we just cannot leave this planet the way my generation found it.","I'm bald, I've been shaving my head long before it got popular.  So, almost everyday I have to shave.  I've gotten the process down pretty well so it doesn't take as long anymore, but it's something I constantly do and think about.  Several days a week I go and cook dinner for my mom, and she always tells me the food is good even if I know I messed it up.  I cook for my girlfriend almost every day and she WILL indeed tell me if I messed it up.  Otherwise, I get up in the morning, make coffee, shower, and drive to work.  So boring that I'm at work now and doing mturk on the side.  Me and my girlfriend have a small place but we've got a little staycation planned for next weekend.  I live in Tampa, so there are plenty of things to do, museums, theme parks, bars, restaurants, etc.  We try to do a little bit of all of it.",5.0,2.833333333333333,5.0,4.833333333333333,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,4.166666666666667,4.166666666666667,4.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,5.5,6.0,3.0,5.0,5.5,6.0,5,2.333333333333333,1.5,4.666666666666667,2,41,6,English,1,5,R_3J2btZWJUOMmL5o,0.056135133,0.03228198,0.21791612,0.08760695,0.07514812,0.24717152,-0.011008041,0.056168392,0.121626675,0.06836861,-0.0706021,0.008729285,0.099615656,0.19373205,0.036520805,0.14876328,0.11218767,0.049347878,-0.01795254,0.025861885,0.11418632,-0.009303141,0.0431248,0.14842576,0.045173004,0.084040545,0.12453167,0.032613926,0.007957026,0.0033841766,0.16921362,0.28508723,0.20444462,0.13289496,0.12787768,-0.010625359,0.03626788,0.041149136,-0.030944474,0.009841019,-0.016522234,0.2760488,0.17964223,0.069022045,0.0585393,-0.10177077,-0.007549295,0.07189328,0.12937959,0.0819475,0.08750637,0.030108027,0.21374734,0.2608491,0.098226875,0.1838193,0.12940946,0.1521114,0.22051673,0.18318675,0.047577817,0.107702315,-0.03031377,-0.117743574,-0.046679843,-0.075913005,0.048436314,0.04330481,0.019309571,0.018232577,0.057270892,0.006827347,0.05496034,0.015503458,0.0060910545,-0.02816439,0.0066403504,-0.021878619,-0.0033960086,-0.0018003117,-0.15750009,-0.08085297,0.02798884,-0.05064843,0.010681066,-0.07887825,-0.011028003,0.13511516,0.081756294,0.070411734,-0.07289566,-0.08130473,-0.033521548,0.039222043,-0.0108952075,0.09794882,-0.009732496,-0.03487157
"I have a few central values that guide me each day and keep me grounded. Number one is loyalty. Understanding who the most important people in your life are each day and treating them as such keeps me focused on the big picture, and that is to love and help each other. Number two is trying to be as honest as possible, but also respectful to others when doing so. Number three is having courage. I also believe trust and hard work are central also.","I have been busy the last week. Monday morning, I went to the bank to open another account for my mother in law. She was having problems paying her bills. We were there for about 3 hours. We also had to pick up kids from school, and kids from work. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday were routine. I went to work from 8-5, came home and did some things around the house such as watch movies, chores, and clean my garage. On Friday after work at went and spent time with some friend. I got home about midnight and went to bed. Saturday I cleaned my yard, ran errands most of the day, and BBQed for the family and watched a late movie on the couch.

"Throughout my life, I've tried to live with integrity, loyalty to family, and genuine attempt to do the greatest good I can. For me, integrity is about being authentic and consistent with my thoughts, words and actions. Loyalty to family in my present circumstance means putting my children as my highest priority and centralizing my responsibilities as a parent above all other roles. Finally, I want to have a positive impact on the people around me and on my surroundings, and no matter what to strive to act in a way that does and promotes goodness.","This past week was spent working and taking care of my sick daughter, who is three years old. I have a long commute, so my weekdays are pretty full with the basics of waking up, getting myself and my daughter around, commuting 45 minutes both ways, and working. I've tried to squeeze in physical activities after work, such as ""micro"" yoga sessions that last 15 minutes to keep healthy and fit. I also like how I can set an example for my kids to make fitness part of their daily lives.",3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,2.0,2.6666666666666665,2.0,3.5,3.333333333333333,4.5,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.5,3.5,14,3.333333333333333,3.0,4.0,1,39,1,English,3,5,R_1dfQnuLkJpAosJf,0.021758273,0.09734872,0.14259735,0.0014659129,0.009784611,0.18607205,0.049427886,-0.005718656,0.0760932,0.10837216,-0.031299807,0.1418101,0.16652054,0.33886433,0.09923919,0.09423057,0.066110715,0.009941205,-0.031546336,0.039913274,0.045921046,0.1148227,-0.12891902,0.013145995,0.024062587,-0.005791218,0.033029515,0.05722093,-0.017248277,0.114537634,0.15686208,0.12285923,0.13172841,0.19555858,0.20829943,0.033261146,0.11849837,0.09709498,0.054810032,-0.037203275,0.071965486,0.21588063,0.051147133,0.08384901,0.056161284,0.056523338,0.055847324,0.08806865,0.16825855,0.1550554,0.09951349,0.097362034,0.1563558,0.25486365,0.08430471,0.19228584,0.053021938,0.08519168,0.195907,0.17291419,0.15661925,0.01345668,0.115070395,0.08108884,0.05101524,0.073737845,0.103886954,0.042114362,0.0082913935,0.023654375,0.14771791,0.054036982,0.16480926,-0.08206688,0.11229374,0.07988739,0.1302717,0.017521331,0.12934203,0.08382827,0.059325382,-0.09420434,0.0045703114,0.031179141,0.00046026707,0.0134248035,0.026520273,0.18012795,0.13348836,0.051645227,0.08972727,0.02163801,0.07696651,-0.0178912,-0.066923216,-0.056512866,0.09558538,-0.0016484391
"Valuing being with family, and putting close family first really guide me.  My kids and husband are the most important factors in my life, and building new traditions and things with them are very important things that guide me.  I was raised in a tight family, so having that value is extremely important.  Another value that I have is sticking to things you love.  If you don't love your job, you are not going to be happy, so I always found that to be a good thing to teach my kids.  I think it helps to prepare you for life to have a strong family, and a drive to do something that you love.","I have worked out 5 days this week,  I have been off of work, because my kids had a stomach flu.  Earlier in the week I took my kids to their friends house, which is where I assume they caught the bug.  Most of the week has been MTurk and TV, while helping my kids get better at home.

"The most important values that guide my life are adventure, knowledge, change, and family. As a queer woman coming from a pretty religious, misogynistic, and paternal family it is important that I achieve my dreams and that those dreams are outside the normal societal expectations. I have already traveled to more countries than anyone in my family ever has. I have been to all 6 continents and lived in New York City. Achieving this when all that was expected of me was to marry a man and have children and never leave my hometown, is very important. I continue to strive for change and adventure and will always do so. I also try to make a point of spending extended time with my elderly parents as much as possible because I know this time will be extremely important to me someday when they are gone.","Starting on Friday, December 10, I began a drive from California to New Mexico. It was a 13 hour drive. I stopped for gas a couple times and to eat lunch at Subway. I arrived at 10pm in New Mexico. On the 11th I spent the day with my New Mexico family. We drove around Santa Fe, ate brunch, got hot chocolate, and then went to their home to chat and make pizza for dinner. On the 12th we went to a arts and crafts festival in Santa Fe where my family sold their crafts. We were there all day. I bought some crafts. We went for dinner afterwards. On the 13th I drove from New Mexico to Texas. It took 9 hours with a couple stops for gas and lunch at Wendy's. On the 14th I watched TV and read and then met my family for dinner at a tamale restaurant. On the 15th I had a phone call with my best friend for two hours. Then I watched TV and read and had dinner. On the 16th I went to see a movie with a friend of mine at the theater. Later that night a family member came over for dinner and we chatted. I ended the night with a Christmas movie. Today I have watched TV and ate lunch so far.",5.0,4.833333333333333,2.333333333333333,1.1666666666666667,1.8333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,5.333333333333333,2.5,5.0,6.0,4.0,3.5,5.5,4.5,5,2.5,1.0,4.333333333333333,1,33,6,English,1,5,R_3xhKkxbvYzXmpAR,0.12425028,-0.0007105591,0.09034043,0.08029492,0.11540487,0.16287337,0.03381848,0.16127013,0.14544354,0.12399058,0.017701041,0.0737581,0.08370064,0.13081673,0.15448661,0.07551562,0.04915347,-0.028592648,-0.030665096,-0.021006059,0.022086415,-0.01658927,0.0113225095,0.052941404,0.0023165261,0.020080147,0.10146562,0.055005036,-0.052019924,-0.0123519935,0.0686862,0.19959775,0.082703315,0.06211693,0.020665903,0.018966865,0.007801516,0.018804824,-0.060392324,-0.031477038,-0.054684855,0.2127153,0.05064846,0.0014997702,0.082386345,-0.085497096,0.044375073,-0.006280279,0.030055504,0.081811264,0.031719245,0.029506506,0.1448036,0.12632303,0.14131644,0.13275379,0.051053993,0.12794141,0.24501377,0.0833039,0.08998166,0.081818,-0.02732566,-0.054265257,0.013588935,0.06914179,0.0456665,0.08932717,0.009041371,0.018185874,0.0048931725,-0.04401204,0.03758827,0.056243192,-0.012135064,-0.056447957,-0.031857673,-0.016558573,-0.023174245,0.10013497,-0.1269331,-0.037993267,-0.039161794,-0.060192913,-0.04423233,-0.07903483,-0.05029172,0.07911925,-0.01771922,0.04863542,-0.11342949,-0.06286362,-0.061525248,-0.035877164,-0.046282582,0.05067295,-0.07788662,-0.05776759
"The one guiding value... well, two guiding values that define who I am is being straightforward and honest when it comes to anyone I talk to or end up meeting regardless of the situation. I came to value this when I learned the hard way that lying only leads to more lies until someone ends up getting unintentionally (or intentionally) hurt in the process... plus I wasn't really a very good liar to begin with. Since those days when I was younger, I've really come to value when someone or something is being honest and straight to the point. It's a value that my family holds in high esteem as well, seeing as how they tend to practice it in their daily lives to the point where it is about as natural as breathing. Another thing I value is kindness, considering that I do my best to come across as that to those who are in need of that metaphorical light in their lives. There's far too many instances where people tend to close themselves off because of what they've been through, and the reasons are understandable... but after a while, one longs for some form of companionship, and it never hurts to start with meeting someone halfway who also wants a similar thing.","For the past seven or so days, I've just been going about a regular routine... or about as regular as it can be given the condition of the world that's still ongoing as I'm typing this. I usually wake up in the morning and start staring at the ceiling while contemplating on what I could do or get done today, and it also doubles as a means of getting rid of that half-asleep feeling. After that, I get out of bed and stretch my arms and legs before immediately opening up my laptop to continue what I was doing or watching the day prior to this next one. What I usually end up watching on YouTube is either video game things, stuff on old technology, old commercials that really get me reminiscing, or cooking in case I was feeling really hungry and waiting for some food to be heated up or made. Related to the video game stuff, it's usually reviews of games I already have or am currently interested in buying and just wanting a second opinion on whether it would be worth the investment.",4.666666666666667,2.1666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.8333333333333335,2.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,4.333333333333333,5.5,2.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,5.0,5.5,5.0,6.0,15,3.1666666666666665,3.5,4.0,2,25,1,English,2,4,R_2B2H2BT2fRjXunw,-0.022563882,0.085146844,0.17371029,0.123501986,0.026614025,0.12763458,0.024613049,0.07894727,0.11311649,0.18603745,0.013077726,0.07170125,0.115617104,0.24028775,0.07909218,0.10526876,0.0323148,0.019803565,-0.09075251,0.059651196,0.059747607,0.0138465995,0.008138738,-0.022175979,0.08221418,-0.0029550232,0.11681439,-0.03409271,0.04942871,-0.01901295,0.1557467,0.2071377,0.1879912,0.15945286,0.1843183,-0.029747248,0.06733662,0.09537408,-0.028859869,0.014154892,-0.032694057,0.3000521,0.14141065,0.16008615,-0.008807741,-0.08042319,0.007470928,0.10696484,0.13502264,0.14980991,0.10081142,0.09719418,0.1595168,0.33386573,0.064531974,0.16361687,-0.008368294,0.10034638,0.2817716,0.23794466,0.1316789,0.096589,0.013244098,-0.046836834,0.03061816,0.072511144,0.07772456,0.10563558,-0.013053471,-0.08819917,0.065201804,0.07353038,-0.027372368,-0.0012991019,0.04643467,0.011431684,0.009453864,0.008587286,-0.026500817,0.13153088,-0.0389155,-0.09720254,-0.02671657,-0.007202198,0.019436797,-0.0123621365,0.024339214,0.09854626,-0.00054202555,0.052182075,-0.05381193,-0.032762438,-0.010013323,-0.013180722,-0.026793273,0.10771881,0.06400056,0.037628986
"More and more I find my main and most basic values revolve around not allowing this sometimes crazy world to make me act crazy. Particularly with national politics and everything seeming to get more extreme, I refuse to allow things to make me become more extreme. I believe extremism is childish and lazy. It also creates conspiracy theories, which are the antithesis of trying to live a reality based life. The far left and far right live in a fantasyland that I want no part of. I teach my children that extremism is not the virtue the extremes pretend it is, that maturity is dealing with reality. I also teach my children they are no better than anyone else and to treat everyone accordingly and to not stoop to the hatred spewed by so many.","My weekdays tend to pretty similar so instead of being repetitive I'll just give the basic rundown. Wake up then wake my children up. Get them cleaned and clothed and fed. Also feed the dog and take him out. My husband is pretty self sufficient so besides making him breakfast sometimes, I don't have to worry too much about him. I also shower and dress in between all this before driving the kids to school and driving myself to work. I work all day, meeting with coworkers sometimes and sometimes working alone. I often take a lunch break to go take the dog out and eat quickly. At the end of the work day I sometimes run errands or pick the kids up from after school activities before heading home to make dinner, make sure homework is done, watch some tv, and get everyone ready for bed before starting all over again. Our weekends have a lot of activities with the kids, for example we went to the beach on Saturday. And my son had a tee ball game on Sunday.",3.8333333333333335,1.3333333333333333,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,3.5,3.5,4.666666666666667,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,12,2.333333333333333,4.5,3.6666666666666665,1,36,6,English,1,5,R_3oLB5JfxqjE7Oqy,-0.01932339,0.06345788,0.17063363,0.071871914,0.057881355,0.12710887,0.023641653,0.00029442832,0.066698276,0.06645451,-0.0714817,0.07985606,0.26856202,0.3558659,0.082182705,0.05201682,0.051264457,-0.0016296823,-0.097847894,-0.0151322875,0.00851053,0.034297395,-0.026821932,0.118511535,0.020257436,0.11468704,0.02226317,0.097478785,-0.007482808,0.039904036,0.18087466,0.09157814,0.029008366,0.15428458,0.1221191,-0.05235569,0.05721901,0.055610903,-0.035662785,-0.06977944,-0.0024706898,0.21046756,0.10690443,0.120176494,0.03177257,0.033576045,-0.033219874,0.047562815,0.03622248,0.1639016,0.057007298,0.02978367,0.11539458,0.22213185,0.07684296,0.21096435,0.10299532,0.055750497,0.28325194,0.08664248,0.10335616,0.11519249,-0.021856682,-0.007313937,-0.03636709,-0.034587927,0.01855304,0.011208804,0.021289151,0.0744767,0.113972604,0.05160212,0.094780155,-0.0034925956,0.055396378,0.029436313,0.00022996403,-0.02489395,0.068236426,0.06447331,0.059003063,-0.088030666,-0.051229134,-0.026943192,-0.066697754,-0.019385956,-0.0014197407,0.17666355,0.108255684,-0.00027621817,0.0584247,0.011863456,-0.0323414,-0.033745628,-0.085728526,-0.087613165,-0.05657991,-0.009225557
"My most central values are guided by my metaphysical spirituality.  I believe we are each a manifestation of our inner divinity and soul.  Therefore, every person is to be respected and valued.  All are equal in value and possibilities.  I believe in equality of gender, race, and nationality.  I believe in non-interference of others.  Each allowed to make their own decisions and accept the beliefs they choose.  I endeavor to embody increasing joy, abundance, and grace of my own inner divinity and allow others to do the same.","For the past 7 days I have done pretty routine activities.  I like to get up around 9 am (I am retired) and fix my own breakfast and coffee (Starbucks) and eat while watching The View.  Then I check email and weather online.  This past week I have gone out every day to get groceries or get a Christmas gift for my Mom.  My favorite grocery store is Fred Meyer.  I also went to Barnes and Noble for the gift.  They had a Thomas Kincade calendar, which my Mom likes.  I prepped a package with this and a Papyrus card, along with chocolate and tea and sent it at the Post Office on Tuesday.  It was delivered today, Friday.  I also did other cooking and dishwashing.  I washed out some clothes and hung them to dry.

"The central and most important values that guide my life are truth and compassion.  Truth is the most central value since it is the foundation for all of existence.  Anything untrue is not real, and is therefore illusory and actually non-existent.  The relative human experience is contained within Truth.

Compassion is the most important value in this relative human experience.  Care and concern for your fellow beings and environment is not only critical for a life well-lived, but it is vital for survival itself.","One week ago, I went for a hike deep into the Dragoon Mountains of Southern Arizona.  The hike commenced at the campsite where I am staying and terminated at an abandoned copper mine.  I later drove into the town of Tombstone, Arizona to explore this historic town.

"I think the fundamental axiomatic belief I hold is that one should try to increase the overall good in the world. I'm still unsure on the overall philosophical school I fall under, but I believe it would be closer to rule utilitarianism than anything else. In pursuit of increasing ""Goodness"", I believe that attacking people based on immutable characteristics decreases overall utility, ergo, sexuality, gender-identity, race, and mental capability. Generally, I fall in line more with the left-most side of the political spectrum, as I believe in a fundamentally deterministic view of human behavior.","As I've been housebound due to my car being disabled, I've spent the majority of my time at home writing various articles as a freelancer.

"The most important values in my life are to be compassionate and to focus on family. For me, family is the single most important thing. I go out of my way on a regular basis to be with my family. I will drop everything in an instant if it means to help one of my family members. They are the only people in the world that come first before anything else. My other value, is to just be compassionate towards other people (excluding family). I strive to be an understanding person and always give someone the benefit of the doubt. I try to not be quick to judge, and I always try to be an outlet for someone if they need someone to talk to. With all of the craziness in the world, I think people just need someone who listens, is compassionate, and can be understanding. I believe this can make a difference in someone's life so I try to be compassionate as I can towards others, even if I do not agree with them.","Making gingerbread houses, wrapping presents, baking, grocery shopping, reading, writing a paper, cleaning my room, going to a family dinner, babysitting, Christmas shopping, mopping the floor, vacuuming, dusting, washing dishes, making tea",5.0,2.333333333333333,4.0,3.8333333333333335,3.8333333333333335,2.0,2.833333333333333,4.166666666666667,4.0,3.5,5.666666666666668,4.0,5.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,5.0,6.0,19,2.6666666666666665,5.0,3.333333333333333,1,23,1,English,1,5,R_3hASLytzdpNnkrP,-0.061717365,0.08786234,0.13446406,0.0697824,-0.035022415,0.20126837,-0.07201908,-0.010891415,0.060363803,0.10607363,-0.06526358,0.046191182,0.09261616,0.26564193,0.015831094,0.086757384,0.048665836,0.090770625,-0.010172732,0.07650164,0.14492708,0.12910494,0.0049144737,0.06135258,0.05517645,0.16824615,0.2186911,0.059439126,0.033433598,0.03011051,0.15337226,0.13277757,0.12793596,0.2626076,0.20236549,-0.026043564,-0.021562833,0.045386143,-0.06402041,-0.0623887,-0.03245403,0.29575855,0.07862827,0.20897402,0.04567962,-0.011005701,0.0294171,0.040834494,0.116135225,0.16805771,0.035934083,0.046181872,0.27576262,0.32993206,0.0646865,0.16070017,0.08256223,0.13606516,0.2801361,0.2470439,0.24520499,0.042973317,-0.040556006,-0.03799598,-0.01049858,-0.03550919,0.02321148,0.0043710936,0.11617512,0.10323117,0.110792845,0.09459615,0.028956946,0.043833554,0.12589353,0.06980668,0.10382732,-0.010372057,0.034035068,0.05285889,-0.041608863,-0.05812946,0.03919699,-0.029407062,-0.053330462,-0.13746303,0.038313672,0.184829,0.050487157,0.042690713,-0.012845892,-0.066143945,0.019947004,0.025579683,-0.07740987,-0.07318801,0.053360518,-0.0075510405

"Ultimately my guiding principle comes from my belief in God. I try to live selflessly and love and serve others. I don't want to just live for my own comfort and pleasure. However, I often find myself living for myself. 

I recognize that life is temporary. Getting physical possessions is not as meaningful as helping someone else, so I want to live in a way that makes other people's lives better, not just my own.

This means we try to give to others and invite people over to spend quality time with others, rather than just living our own private, separate lives.

I am always looking opportunities for the ""next right thing"" and I pray for how my life should go.

I try to love and serve my wife as well, so I am working to make sure the way I live does not sacrifice my relationship with my family.","Last Friday I went to work as normal. Then in the evening, we had our friends over for dinner. They came over and we had chicken curry over rice. Then we sat and talked for a while.

On Saturday we went to Costco to purchase new glasses. Other than that we just relaxed and did some Christmas decorating.

On Sunday we went to church in the morning and ate out for lunch at Taco Bus (Yum!)

Monday I had my normal work routine. We watched Penn and Teller that evening.

Tuesday night Sarah had a piano recital and it was nice to have people over in our homes. Then Thursday night was Sarah's band concert, which I went to and watched Marley.

Today I am wrapping up work for the week.

"The guiding principles of my life are difficult to define. I know that they center around my family. Although my family is small, my mother is probably who I think about the most, as I am her caregiver, and I need to make sure that she is never in need of something that I can provide. My children are the most important people to me, and I wish I spent more time making memories. But I know that I have held them close, and even if we haven't been able to travel and do things together that require the ability to leave an aging parent alone (or money), I know that I spend time with them at home. I love them and talk to them and we are bonded. My husband is my touchstone, and though we have had our troubles, I feel like I am home when I am with him.","Well, let's see here.. 7 days ago would have started at this time last Friday. Last Friday, I headed home, and we didn't really have anything good to eat, as I recall, so we ordered a pizza, as we normally do. I don't think we had much of a fun Friday evening-I recall that it was sort of a crappy Friday, as Fridays go. I think Saturday found me getting up and going downstairs to talk to my mom to try and take her out. She takes pain meds, but I think that she had taken them twice, because she was really out of it, and we wound up spending all day tied to the house. I was afraid to do anything because I knew she'd be mad that she couldn't go out and that I did. Except she was too dopey to go in the car.
Sunday found me pissed off at my mother, and so I didn't take her out and didn't feel bad about it. I stayed around the house on Sunday, cleaning my room specifically, and decluttering.
I recall that my mother's cat had somehow gotten into my room when my husband left the door open briefly, and the cat had obviously sprayed someplace in the room. I was cleaning late into the evening so that I",4.166666666666667,1.6666666666666667,2.5,1.8333333333333333,2.333333333333333,2.0,2.5,3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,5.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,19,2.833333333333333,2.0,3.6666666666666665,1,51,1,English,1,5,R_1kFbKty8Wmeh9GO,-0.03817012,-0.049556542,0.062028456,-0.05241244,-0.013393836,0.15240344,-0.0018280698,0.045200713,-0.01544201,0.009648729,-0.07535096,-0.072849706,0.044164576,0.07199384,0.033998586,0.06856866,0.023832794,0.121470615,-0.06213077,-0.08237558,-0.011929218,-0.024895445,0.011244017,-0.0036469535,-0.061803635,-0.0045656683,-0.030313045,0.051918086,-0.11723526,-0.07998482,0.10034779,0.12987998,0.078857236,-0.06818332,-0.037504278,-0.050437115,-0.0030238512,0.01711652,-0.056272667,0.015854737,-0.0758116,0.058386575,0.029896932,-0.12187222,-0.026195219,-0.07483086,-0.08562806,-0.046778444,-0.09782081,-0.092873976,0.009511804,-0.013423737,0.036427297,0.024731744,0.100403324,0.09305601,-0.09701391,0.008115395,0.13975482,-0.026723538,-0.0409791,0.0018718522,0.034184504,0.0050558597,0.09253077,0.10535233,0.11698626,0.048243877,-0.10676379,-0.080315046,-0.062445387,-0.12363398,-0.07686189,-0.09619594,-0.10321,-0.13911252,-0.090091206,-0.12972711,-0.08513032,0.07587658,-0.1700039,-0.14433175,-0.069988616,-0.10352254,-0.1671073,-0.07865202,-0.1472457,0.010378742,0.09412366,0.05180761,-0.04784386,-0.13221976,-0.024281356,-0.061909307,-0.039542943,0.03503754,-0.037844032,-0.14209895
One of my most important values is integrity. I find it the most important because of how it impacts so many behaviors and actions in your life. Living with integrity allows me to feel confident in how I treat others and ensure that I feel good about my actions at the end of the day. I think that compassion comes in a close second. Compassion allows me to assist others in ways that I may not have considered and will propel my opportunities to put goodness in the world. I think both of these values are important because of how much we interact with people around us and the impact we have on their lives. Living with both of these values means that each person I interact with can walk away feeling positive and happy. I enjoy making sure that I am honest with each of these to ensure I live by my moral code.  Each of these three moral principles requires constantly checking in with myself to ensure that I am following them and making the best decisions available to others and myself.,"I normally like to wake up at a consistent time which is 7:30 A.M. I always start with getting up and making some coffee. I have several options to choose from but this week I have enjoyed drinking  Pumpkin Spice blend for the morning time. After I finish my coffee I start my day by reading the news. I normally spend about an hour getting current on events and local news before I brush my teach and get dressed. It was Friday so I like to plan my day with a to-do list that will allow me to make the most of it before the weekend. I sent several emails and then headed to work. I like to take a cup of coffee to go for the ride to work as it's pretty long and gets cold in the mornings. I arrived to work where I finished a meeting and then left around 2 p.m. I ate a late lunch and then headed off to the gym to get my daily workout in. Once I finished my work out I came home and started my to-do list. I finished up and began to make dinner. I have really enjoyed baking chicken breasts with a few different vegetables to pair it with. I decided to spend my night catching up on my favorite show The Witcher and then I went to bed. On the weekends I typically go for a long walk after my morning routine. I like to get some activity in before the day begins to really help wake up my body. After that, I met up with several family and friends and we had a great time shopping and watching a new movie nearby. In the evening I set up my weekly schedule and started the new to-do list to make the best productive week possible.

"Some big core values I hold in my daily life is to always hold myself and others accountable. I think it's very important to live a life of rationality and honesty. Holding myself and others accountable keeps my life and emotional state productive. Besides that, I always think it's important to me to help others when possible. No matter the crimstuances. Do not make life harder than it already is.","The last seven days have been pretty typical for me and consistent. I started by waking up in the morning, after that I take the medication I have to take daily as soon as I wake up. I wait for my medicine to kick in and then I go down the stairs with my dogs so they can use the bathroom while I make coffee and a salad for my guinea pigs. After that, I come back upstairs, feed my pigs, and go to work on Mturk. Some days I clean the room and the cages to keep everything nice and tidy.

"I can boil down my values pretty fast. All the parts in the Bible that are written in the red ink and start with ""Jesus said,"" those are the basis of my life philosophy.  You have to add in a little Wiccan ""do no harm"" and some Stoic philosophy of finding contentment with what you have but it's pretty simple. I do my best with what I have to support me and mine, while not hurting anyone else. I also don't waste things if there is extra of something you share it or donate it.","Every day I get up in the morning and take the dog out. I see to it he's fed and happy. Then I do a load of laundry. After that the ""fun part"" starts. I get my 95-year-old, Mother-in-law up and dressed. This requires getting three different sets of clothes out her closet to play ""what do we think matches today."" After that we both have breakfast, eggs, toast, yogurt, coffee and juice. After that I put on her chair exercises. She never really does the exercises, but she waves her arms around and stamps her feet on the floor which I guess is some kind of exercise. While that's going on I move the laundry and M-Turk for a while before getting lunch together, generally, it's soup and sandwiches. She sleeps after lunch, so I have some peace to do the quiet housework and put away laundry. The nights kind of vary yesterday I went to work for a few hours then came home ate dinner put my Mother-in-law to bed after playing the game ""which night gown looks pretty this time"".

"The values that guide my life are my family values, I love my family more than anything and spend my free time working on my relationships with them. I am super close with them and think that it is extremely important to have a family support system, regardless of whether or not you are actually related, or a family that you have created along your life journey. It is the greatest asset a person can have and is worth the effort to help them and be open and honest with them.","Saturday, I slept in and relaxed for most of the beginning on the day. I went to a viewing and funeral for an uncle in the afternoon, then had dinner with family that evening. Sunday, I drove about an hour away to spend the day at my sisters house where we made christmas cookies, played with her kids, and hung out. On Monday, I woke up not feeling well so I decided to spend my morning on the couch, drinking tea. I started feeling better in the afternoon and decided to get some work done around the house. I did the dishes, picked up laundry from the bedrooms and bathrooms, and then spend time working on my jewelry making crafts. When my husband got off work at 5, we watched a movie and then I made dinner. We watched more tv and hung out until going to bed. Tuesday was similar. I did many of the same tasks, and had a job interview for a staffing agency in the morning. The rest of the day after that, i hung out with my husband and dogs until dinner time. Wednesday, I did my grocery shopping and errands, then picked up my brother from the bus stop and spent the rest of the day with him playing games. On Thursday, I got my last minute Christmas shopping done and ran errands, then did my usual daily routines. Today i had another interview and picked up an order i had placed at the mall.

"I think one of the most important values I have is being kind to others. We all go through things as humans, and we all have struggles and a story. It is not ok to be unkind to anyone since you never know what's going on in anyone else's life. I also think it is important to be self aware. Admit the mistakes that you make. Try to improve where you feel you need to, and never stop trying to grow and be better.","For the past 7 days, I have went to work for 5 of them. I worked on trainings and my normal job. I visited my oldest in the hospiatal, and taken a lot of phone calls for her mental health. One day, I made steak gorgonzola. It was so good! We had a Christmas party at work, and it was really a great time. I ran into my mother in law while I was out shopping. That was fun. We took my youngest to see Santa. He loved him and told Santa that he wanted a shotgun for Christmas. He is only 3! We think he meant a Nerf gun, but never too early to start getting him interested in hunting.",4.166666666666667,3.0,2.833333333333333,3.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,3.1666666666666665,2.833333333333333,3.6666666666666665,4.5,3.5,5.333333333333333,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,6.0,13,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.0,1,38,1,Englisg,1,2,R_cRSM90OnTkgz237,-0.0036160513,0.0069115944,0.18352126,0.08035329,0.026528552,0.17186525,0.07431081,0.031637847,0.11732065,0.12570477,-0.034307245,0.09012225,0.23292986,0.23782292,0.0719823,0.07004961,0.098588526,0.06724959,-0.03889615,0.10761395,0.029979866,0.10257177,0.22686148,0.029608767,0.0731754,0.04846406,0.071550675,0.03432197,-0.012811232,-0.04057525,0.17505065,0.09955685,0.114751816,0.15807502,0.04887913,-0.02392339,0.0793694,0.068683304,-0.019316735,-0.013194138,-0.004614709,0.1689631,0.06437267,0.07130147,0.046636026,-0.022901356,0.03382495,0.07381345,0.07106461,0.14547661,0.09749357,0.10236399,0.23914072,0.21312033,0.16191903,0.13148396,0.094306655,0.119373135,0.1887278,0.066056035,0.20504338,0.09197807,0.041947696,0.06077477,0.0023589842,0.08076264,0.03641272,0.07621451,0.003952386,-0.025974955,0.09738675,0.06962705,0.10465595,0.019344956,0.071577765,0.033658545,0.0488717,0.067938656,-0.011567615,0.08041849,0.058070466,-0.033085227,0.014253676,0.020235403,-0.07027429,-0.026410475,0.021529442,0.1273296,0.13035148,0.1119459,0.121927254,0.068651244,0.029085238,-0.029348146,-0.04430838,0.10581208,-0.0043351427,-0.032582402
"My guiding principles in making decisions and interactions with others is the Catholic Church, Jesus, & the Holy Spirit.

Reading the Bible & sensing the internal Holy Spirit, and hearing the interpretations of the scripture by the Church brings awesome outcomes and helps me to make decisions and though many times the actions I take seem contrary to the outside world... they turn out right and perfect... miraculously!","I took buses to shop for groceries 3 times. I had a Dr. appointment and was driven by the local Office for the Aging free medical ride program driver. Going to my cat's Veterinarian to pick up the 2 prescriptions for them was on the list.

Priest from church called me as well as my Credit Union. Cooking from scratch is always going on in the background, as is Christian Radio. It was necessary to call the church where I was baptised 40 years ago to find out how to get a proof of baptism.

Making the bed, doing laundry, online class and some mTurk surveys also made up my week.

"I try to live by strong values. I believe in treating all living creatures equally, including animals. This is the main reason I took up vegetarianism several years ago. I also believe in kindness. I practice this via teaching and my interactions with others. On top of this, I also believe in standing against those you think are wrong. If this means being unkind, I am okay with that. For example, if I need to speak up against an authority figure who has treated me poorly, I believe this is the right thing to do. 
I believe honesty is very important. I do everything I can to always be honest. I will never pretend to be someone's friend. I believe that life is too short to waste time on pleasantries with people you do not like. I like to save those kind words for those I care about and truly mean it. This makes it so people can always trust me because they know I am truthful, even with tough stuff.","This past week I went to work. I had some meetings after school for work since I am a teacher. I ordered pizza one night and had leftovers for several nights after. Over the weekend, I stayed at my apartment. I watched a lot of tv and movies. I drank a little too much. I ended up feeling really tired on Sunday. During the week, I started to feel like I have a cold. I still had to go to work though, because I cannot call out many days. After school this past week, I have been wrapping christmas gifts. I have also written christmas cards for family to send in the mail.

"Being “Born Again” was the most meaningful thing in my life. Nothing can compare to it.  I had not been aware of it; I was raised a Catholic, and those words were never mentioned.  The sheer joy in knowing that the Almighty God knows me is incredible in its self, but knowing that he accepts me with all my flaws and has a place for me in his kingdom is surreal!

The Bible guides my life and my decisions. Dealing with people, in general, is a cautious step these days when people are programmed to cancel you for one word or tweet you may have done years ago. Forgiveness isn’t in the Leftist/Socialist dictum. I try to see things from others’ perspectives often.  This helps with communication with different ideas that people have formed, right or wrong.  

God is first, NOT RELIGION. But, unfortunately, the two are often conflated wrongly.

Politics are important to me more than ever as the rise of evil in our lives has reached a dangerous point, and the FALL of America is in serious question!  

IGNORANT or EVIL?  Mass Genocide is occurring right beneath our noses! People are being kept in the dark; in the darkness, EVIL reigns.  The orchestrators of this madness are on a mission to rid the earth of useless mouths.

 The FEARMONGERING since this PLANNEDEMIC began has met with great success, both in America and around the world. But, unfortunately, fear is paramount when it comes to controlling the masses. 

They are trampling on our CONSTITUTION RIGHTS with ever-increasing boldness day after day; our freedom diminishes as the tyranny grows. 

The Demonic Quintet; BigPharma, Mainstream Media, BigTech, Government, Academia, and Satan himself, be it the personification Bill Gates, George Soros, or Tony Fauci if not possessed they are all certainly doing his bidding. 

Hospitals and many doctors are in lockstep with BigPharma by not only failing to provide Proven Medications that are both SAFE AND EFFECTIVE but instead administering drugs that are extremely ineffective and deadly. 

“Covid-19 cases are high as we head into the holidays, and we must take every measure we can to keep our families and loved ones safe – which starts with getting vaccinated,” Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive, said in a statement. Absolute BULL****

"One of my central beliefs is that people must be dealt with consistently and fairly. I don't like the idea of engaging with people on the basis of preconceived notions of who that might be because of what group to which they might belong. When I meet a person, I am first and foremost meeting a fellow human being. The process of understanding that human being might be shaped by previous experience, but understanding can never be solely determined by previous experience.
I also believe that coercion of other people must be kept to a minimum. There are essential human rights with regard to self-determination of religion, speech, social attachment, etc.
I also believe that a fundamental good is obtained by helping other human beings. This is not always easy given the other values that I mentioned previously: There have been many well-intentioned people in the past who have tried to ""help"" others and who in so doing either violated the rights of others or who engaged in some form of patronization which pushed their own shortcomings onto others disguised as gifts.
I can only understand myself and grow if I allow others to come into my life and assist me in my growth. It is important to maintain one's sense of independence and individuality, but if that sense of independence becomes all-important, then I will become permanently isolated and ""stuck.""","Last Friday through Tuesday, I worked the late evening to early morning shifts at the grocery store at which I work. My life on work days is quite regular: I awake from sleep sometime between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. I prepare myself a cup of coffee and look at the news online and also look at Facebook to see what is happening with my friends and family. As a diversion, I play the game Scrabble Go on my handset. I invest in a variety of stocks and funds, so I often spend some time each day investigating market news and information. About two hours before my work day is to begin, I begin to prepare myself mentally for the workday ahead. I am a cashier at a grocery store. Retail is a difficult area in which to work at the present time owing to the increasingly poor public behavior evidenced by many. So I steel myself for the day by preparing myself mentally for what I might encounter, and by making myself as physically comfortable as possible. I make sure my body is well-hydrated and that I feel clean and comfortable before going to work. When I am at work, I try to concentrate on doing my job as effectively as possible. I try to be positive and upbeat with customers as much as I can. I am sympathetic and try to be helpful to both my coworkers and customers. I work hard at a job which is often repetitive and mentally unrewarding.
Once I drive home from work, I try to unwind and let the other parts of my mind find time to function. I am very interested in history and archaeology of late, so I often find videos on Youtube which relate to these topics. I also enjoy Scrabble, so I play Scrabble Go on my phone quite a bit.
I live in the snow belt, and last Friday we received our first major snowstorm of the year. I rent an upstairs suite of rooms with 3 other people and we are responsible for shoveling parts of the property. So, last Saturday I spent 2 1/2 hours shoveling snow. It is an activity I have engaged in for many years and I am actually quite fond of it. There is a sense of accomplishment to being able to look back at a cleared walkway or path after having shoveled it, remembering that only a short while earlier it had been a small sea of whiteness.
During my days off, I like to engage in long walks. This past Tuesday and Wednesday were consecutive days off for me, a rarity of late. On Tuesday I took a long walk and after it went to an Asian-themed grocery and purchased a prepared meal from its deli. This is a luxury for me. 
I also spend a good bit of time investigating my ancestry. I have taken a DNA test and assembled a family tree on a popular genealogical website. I try to review as many hints and do research as much as I can.",4.0,2.1666666666666665,4.0,3.5,3.1666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,3.5,5.0,3.5,5.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,12,2.833333333333333,4.0,4.0,2,61,7,English,16,5,R_3rZZyk21mbFM38n,0.049432926,0.12474434,0.20801201,0.1539005,0.12902775,0.13417237,0.06165641,0.13636251,0.16242456,0.12040202,0.0649399,0.1622341,0.1534723,0.26653314,0.16011801,0.1578252,0.1459718,-0.0020431317,-0.06457814,0.047548193,0.028717559,0.0016127303,0.05968426,0.01912307,0.09594618,0.082047835,0.21591842,-0.031193715,0.043501806,0.09898289,0.28853944,0.20208706,0.2400588,0.20767981,0.23225705,0.026902536,0.17355494,0.08739796,0.06624553,0.008134397,0.043706775,0.36395377,0.17093225,0.17382076,0.14362879,-0.010840777,0.11539769,0.031501044,0.18077771,0.2867877,0.12014958,0.124626,0.14392866,0.17524055,0.1355536,0.30443564,0.20206471,0.21036986,0.32450283,0.17269471,0.15187559,0.12099817,0.015782297,0.011176176,-0.026270555,0.024488343,0.0931061,0.084910214,-0.0063415626,0.009512089,0.10238023,0.061817616,0.10734992,0.05949503,0.18211399,0.034496635,0.1671429,0.07694891,0.13479967,0.15778863,-0.076369435,-0.06473538,-0.06479969,-0.0350304,0.04827121,-0.024818182,0.0776754,0.17837062,0.048371322,0.024105046,0.0034216717,0.06848339,-0.005228689,-0.020404644,-0.062060274,0.003408271,0.01812249,-0.06158284
"Well in every dealing , in all relationships, I pride myself on being utterly honest. I think that's my biggest principle in life. I have to be honest with one even if my honest reply hurts. Though I do word it delicately, I still say it. I would want the same for me. Honest gives individuals the choice of hearing your news, I feel like it should not be taken away. It builds trust a bonds with others.","Ummmm, okay for the past week... Well today is Friday, it was early release at school for my son, so he is home with me, until next year. So I'm big on exercise, so I attend the gym four days, I exercised at home on Tuesday however. It has only been my so and I at home this week so I've only cooked dinner twice and the other days have been fend for yourself nights.... I start my day around 6:25 a.m every school day, as to get up with my son, because he is not responsible and will go back to sleep. Then it is gym at 8. Then once I'm back home, and settled, I work Amazon M Turk to make extra monies. I am disabled after I had cancer and subsequent brain tumor surgery. So this is a way for me to make extra. Wednesday was laundry day, so I did that. I did lite house cleaning on that day as well. Yesterday I got my last packaged mailed in for gifts, so I am finally done with that. Just got to wrap up my gifts. I had coffee every single day, OMG I love my coffee and have to have it! Lol.

"My values include always being caring. Never lie. Always tell the truth no matter how hard it is. Not stealing. Not taking from the less fortunate. Always be the best that I can be. Family, freedom, and loyalty are very important values to me. Creativity is also an important value to me. They are in a relationship with who I am because that's what I follow to the core.","On Monday I Wake up and make my bed and make some iced coffee.

"Writing about central values is more challenging than writing about everyday activities. I think that one guiding principle is to be nice to other people. For example, I talked to my neighbor yesterday to be friendly and make positive connections with people in my neighborhood. I think most of my guiding principles are about being kind and understanding. The Golden Rule is a good principle to live by: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If everyone followed this rule, the world would be a better place.","The last week has been fairly routine. Starting a week ago, I went to work as usual after having breakfast. Later there was lunch, then coming home and having dinner, then going to bed. It is hard to remember many more details from a week ago. Subsequent days were very similar, waking up and having coffee and breakfast, then working, having lunch, and coming home for dinner. One night I watched a movie at home, and another night watched some tv. Yesterday is easier to remember. One of my neighbors was outside working on their car, and I went outside to talk to them. We talked for a little while while they worked on the car. Moving to the present moment, I have signed into MTurk to make a little extra money to help with Christmas bills.",3.5,4.5,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.5,1.6666666666666667,2.833333333333333,3.5,3.5,1.5,5.333333333333333,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,22,3.0,2.0,3.0,1,51,1,English,1,5,R_XgLmuB8LIkLqfS1,0.035760976,0.004636511,0.10896903,0.0202633,0.07443608,0.1620751,0.023529716,0.104344,0.15220904,0.08816547,-0.003579352,0.0646675,0.17055723,0.21773233,0.026608132,0.092600755,0.07540466,-0.11477008,-0.035908706,-0.027168758,0.007129684,0.09210399,0.0248391,0.055400215,0.07328463,0.13686523,0.1232347,0.057320427,0.03090054,-0.057358302,0.1364242,0.10098797,0.11366165,0.08349585,0.020717127,0.01891171,0.044417024,-0.016301,-0.06425868,-0.031236615,0.004817391,0.20825796,0.040940687,0.06268102,0.05166238,-0.11762613,0.06863502,-0.06754479,-0.029650552,0.10530572,0.036281906,0.01607396,0.13776088,0.11881597,0.09243255,0.17834997,0.08317222,0.12892199,0.22082251,0.024425555,0.12619196,0.09112278,0.018810276,-0.0119964015,-0.015531529,0.07114346,0.065092765,0.0690452,0.046959206,0.06528816,0.044065736,0.035818152,0.11082667,0.16932616,0.13708788,0.016300611,0.11153922,0.01817333,0.021332955,0.08788352,-0.120351836,-0.041896995,-0.08928195,-0.110853866,-0.049580965,-0.05590472,-0.00095288455,0.12956145,-0.026338104,0.046207607,-0.07884867,-0.032356996,-0.13228893,-0.027460907,-0.120851785,0.0391601,-0.0927199,-0.12008989
"The most important values in my life are respect for all life, inner peace, and humility. In my life, there are have been times that I have truly exceled at following these values, and other times that I have fell short. I will go through each of these values in more detail. As far as respect for all life goes, I feel that in all of my life decisions, I try to determine how other lives were or are impacted by my decisions. For example, I try to eat a vegetarian diet, and most of the time, eat completely plant-based. I do this because I know that animals that are sent to slaughter houses are not treated with dignity and respect in their last moments. By purchasing the meat, it means that I am supporting this behavior, and therefore am not displaying respect for the innocent animals that have been slaughtered. I also try to think of environmental impacts when I make decisions about what to buy. For example, before I buy anything, I always ask myself if it is something I can do without, something I can make, or something that I can buy used. Only if the answer is no to all of those questions do I buy something new. When I do buy goods, I try to buy as local as possible because it means less transport and therefore less carbon emissions. Inner peace is a value of mine because I feel that when I have inner peace, I can then emit that peaceful energy to others in my life. When I have inner peace, I am at my absolute best. I have infinite patience for my family, I make good decisions with my own life, and I don't do things like speed when I drive or honk my horn when I am annoyed at other drivers. I also find that I don't compare myself to others. I am just at peace in every way. Lastly, humility. Knowing my place in the universe is so incredibly tiny, spontaneous, and unlikely keeps me in check. My problems are so miniscule compared to many others, and also compared to the great expanse of the universe. Having the mindset that I am just a tiny speck of dust on a tiny blue dot floating in space keeps me humble and treating others with the utmost respect, and giving others my full attention.","Things that I have done in the last seven days. Probably the easiest way to do this in separate paragraphs, organized by different types of activities. I know this deviates a bit from the organization suggested above, but I feel like it is the only way I can do it. 

Once a week activities: I baked two loafs of whole wheat bread on Tuesday, and froze one of the loafs for use later. I also worked on planning my vegetable garden for the next season, and started a list for ordering from the seed catalog. In addition, I cleaned all the windows of the house, cleaned the bathroom, and meal planned for the week. I also grocery shopped. I also dropped off the rest of the Christmas cards to the post office. 

A few times a week activities: Every other day, I catch up on laundry, so each of those days I do at least one load of laundry. I also sweep every room in the house and vacuum all of the carpets. I try to work out a few times a week, so this week I did three days of calisthenics and squats. I also cleaned out the refrigerator a few times and organized the pantry. It gets messy quick with little kids around. 

Every day activities: I cook breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day for my family. My husband works outside the home during the week, but I am home to cook for my son every day. I also do the dishes every night, and clean the dishwasher out every morning. I check the mail, take my son to the park, and play in the backyard with him every day. I drink coffee every day, and feed and take my dog out to potty every day. I sit and drink tea and read every night, and have at least an hour of alone time with my husband every night after our child goes to sleep.",5.0,3.8333333333333335,3.0,2.0,3.1666666666666665,2.5,3.8333333333333335,3.8333333333333335,5.0,2.0,6.0,2.5,3.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,14,3.333333333333333,3.5,3.5,1,32,1,English,1,6,R_1nZyIn8lvp4dv19,-0.08576588,0.057036065,0.11740954,0.089057654,0.06280354,0.20738386,-0.013425335,0.025608677,0.16062057,0.039611608,-0.02279487,0.13094519,0.19618994,0.325682,0.022148907,0.11335217,0.13363515,0.014842376,-0.0036819726,0.0072075278,-0.00053479895,0.00470417,-0.059458725,-0.014829711,-0.033364948,0.16683185,0.1365428,0.0810931,-0.03576559,0.1265666,0.17038822,0.16783321,0.15979265,0.2059424,0.20519593,-0.058512352,0.0393146,-0.0018120185,-0.07150827,-0.08837033,-0.010678202,0.26568046,0.03573875,0.06392984,-0.0071351267,-0.056284633,-0.032934263,-0.021890732,0.07546899,0.131659,-0.01668528,-0.027124634,0.19635183,0.2709493,0.10730213,0.24076322,0.043313798,0.11260888,0.24032634,0.07729457,0.108377695,0.00864855,-0.046816666,-0.08042503,-0.07216932,-0.03939024,0.01093971,-0.032900028,0.05577183,0.055213954,0.12463985,0.017098473,0.12132616,-0.028110754,0.06265844,0.03486871,0.044769935,-0.07294957,0.023694605,0.06211192,-0.106547154,-0.13445315,-0.032644637,-0.086961776,-0.04724122,-0.10414776,-0.05831618,0.20695375,0.020456605,0.015844742,-0.09483744,-0.01328804,-0.07827194,-0.053347316,-0.11804724,-0.04166879,0.0023507625,-0.14721183
"I use the Bible, prayer, and the Holy Spirit to make the most important decisions and to guide my values in life. When it comes it difficult decisions there is only one guidebook to life that I know to be accurate and true: the Bible. I can go to it for answers for anything that I may have questions about. There is literally nothing new under the sun and nothing that cannot be solved by searching through the scriptures. I also depend on prayer and communication with God through the Holy Spirit to make my decisions. He is my guide and I can count on answers from Him that are correct and true when I have an important decision to make. These same values are shared with the people who are most important in my life as well.","Since last Friday I have been to practice for Christmas Cantata, baked cookies, baked bread, made dinners, done laundry, written three thank you notes, anonymously sent gifts cards to a person in need, called to cancel reservations at a hotel, made reservations at an Airbnb for next April's vacation, texted with my mom and sister, wrapped presents, watered the Christmas tree, vacuumed the floor, cleaned the bathroom, made copies for a meeting, attended a business meeting, taught a Bible study, completed an Advent Bible study, finished a book, made a phone call, delivered Christmas goodies to three different people, shopped for groceries, researched how to make a Hot Cocoa Bar.",3.8333333333333335,1.0,4.5,3.1666666666666665,5.0,4.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,4.5,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,6.0,2.5,5.0,26,2.6666666666666665,7.0,3.6666666666666665,1,44,1,English,1,5,R_3L4FZgC5TlapUcw,0.06070713,0.18740231,0.1197295,0.09680743,0.10236489,0.23083037,0.08383475,0.16288462,0.1561222,0.15815343,0.066658095,0.25806072,0.3070485,0.38232642,0.25798815,0.20407915,0.24084492,0.087935,0.012358205,0.034274183,0.17007312,0.05530615,0.019549794,0.16482535,0.14137332,0.08312552,0.21212065,0.08014006,0.03169952,0.03248371,0.22412042,0.1647278,0.16289853,0.26777652,0.1264432,-0.011019581,0.08654633,0.038010005,-0.024184076,0.017323287,0.012184061,0.26945853,0.09415087,0.13279617,0.24381931,0.027684541,0.21218984,-0.01606564,0.2561072,0.23194535,0.08415633,0.09314054,0.32624793,0.22473137,0.16788654,0.2555015,0.23215331,0.31250387,0.28331643,0.2701811,0.26500717,0.089741625,0.1355262,0.10504334,0.06686556,0.17697394,0.1081426,0.08588695,0.04300552,-0.007020354,0.078659885,0.03967236,0.087416805,0.023454847,0.005781932,0.062566884,0.052041233,0.14334914,0.006514037,0.12717727,-0.047058508,-0.005921699,0.04857413,-0.03497132,0.00043494254,-0.062875636,0.0826557,0.29061562,0.087685704,0.1747213,0.0908476,0.038292203,0.05956742,0.11048415,-0.021257253,0.09692913,0.010530427,0.0678068
"My most distinctive characteristic is my independence and originality.  I didn't have much of a family and was never ""raised"" in any particular way.  If I learned anything in youth it was to be distrustful of authority figures and only rely upon myself.  I have carried this belief with me into and through adulthood.

My values have changed over time.  I have become extremely egalitarian and politically active.  I find the United States government to be absolutely abhorrent in nearly every respect, regardless of which of the two major parties is in power.   One of my guiding principles is to elevate meritocracy above privilege or aristocracy.   We seem to live in a sort of kakistocracy, ruled by an absurd and indolent caste of unweaned adult sucklings who could not even pay their own rent as young adults, yet somehow presume the standing to opine on such things as whether or not this person or that person should receive health care.  

I think community is important but I am not a particularly social or sociable person.  Probably this is something I should work on in the remainder of my allotted time on our planet.","A week ago I was talking to my dear friend who recently left the hospital.  She had a mysterious illness that worried us quite a lot, and her condition is still perplexing.  It worries me a great deal.

Last weekend I relaxed at home.  Usually this involves playing video games, watching the Cleveland Browns, and playing chess online against some of the country's best rated tournament players.  I say this because I have no specific memory of doing any of those things.  I don't even remember which team the Browns played --- and yet I'm sure that they played and that I watched them.  Curious.

At work this week I was mostly involved with a new project, which is to install a customer relations management software.  The seller has a team to help us with that but their assistance is promised for only the remainder of the month.  We're operating under a deadline. 

I also have some routine tasks at work; e.g., managing my six employees, meeting with the occasional client.  On Wednesday I traveled downtown to meet with a judge and opposing counsel on a criminal case.  But the rest of the week I remained in the office.",4.5,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.5,3.6666666666666665,2.5,5.0,1.5,5.333333333333333,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.5,5,3.333333333333333,2.5,4.166666666666667,2,63,6,English,1,6,R_31d6JRd4iVpK4WM,0.014266282,-0.026601557,0.12300362,0.044157557,0.116377085,0.13871145,0.13787894,0.21539962,0.15034172,0.09842005,0.03656842,0.1167373,0.1738875,0.21823798,0.10462019,0.005076536,0.03989624,0.050879657,0.047108,0.11217726,0.023764748,0.08192014,0.0719864,-0.02277829,0.024189852,0.09158076,0.23346363,0.09038332,0.050114915,0.026612658,0.2701772,0.2051346,0.1338205,0.09352292,0.13541098,0.02116922,0.18276185,0.08631058,0.06716486,0.07499157,-0.009953249,0.15005589,0.099229366,-0.042476837,0.07526066,-0.044073753,0.029439693,-0.052704956,0.05767176,0.12924816,0.020671792,0.11313148,0.07357948,0.08287419,0.16667223,0.17828871,0.019466288,-0.013879713,0.28000486,0.08341276,0.13608053,0.11413288,0.18269096,0.08457129,0.119295254,0.15083528,0.16598944,0.14305589,-0.04345872,-0.03282318,-0.020357637,0.039073765,0.17404163,-0.025228847,0.089991964,-0.033335395,0.11029567,-0.0023207888,0.054267768,0.16292743,-0.1381506,-0.043337405,-0.035559803,-0.001757795,0.05277787,0.1786525,-0.08111904,0.08724136,-0.022058353,0.021333529,-0.03509479,-0.030934662,-0.03250806,-0.013041064,-0.01184146,0.11387232,-0.06695498,-0.06509848

"One value that is very important to me is to take care of the people I care about. By extension, that includes animals as well. My girlfriend and I have three cats and a dog. To take care of them, and my girlfriend, and to just survive in this capitalistic society, I have to work full time so I can afford shelter and food for myself and everyone else. That's why most of my days are taken up by my job. I also care deeply about my health, which is why I go to the gym most days of the week. Exercise has been proven to better pretty much every aspect of health. Plus, I just like doing it.","There isn't a lot of variety in my typical week since I am a product of a capitalistic society. Pretty much any given day (Sundays are my only guaranteed day off), I wake up around 5:30 am and make myself breakfast, usually bread with peanut butter if I'm still tired, or pancakes. I eat breakfast, and then spend a little bit of time with my girlfriend before she goes to work. I then go to the gym at about 6:30 or 7 am, and stay there until around 8:15-8:30 am. I get home, change, make a protein shake, and play with my dog for a little, and then I go to work. My work day starts at 9am and I get off at 6pm. Once I get home, I make dinner while my girlfriend and I tell each other about our days. We eat dinner, and then relax on the couch for a little watching whatever  we feel like watching on TV that night. At around 8pm, I take the dog for a walk. When I get home, I usually do the dishes for the day, and then we go to our rooms and get ready for bed. I usually spend about a half an hour playing with the cats, then I shower, brush my teeth, and then go to sleep. I wake up the next day and do the same thing.",3.5,3.0,4.333333333333333,2.833333333333333,2.833333333333333,1.5,3.5,3.5,5.0,4.0,5.333333333333333,4.5,5.0,4.5,5.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,11,3.1666666666666665,3.0,4.0,2,29,1,English,13,5,R_2Wvf6fcWITxdXO4,0.031215535,0.08632172,0.16909017,0.19096197,0.028771382,0.15572537,0.035188146,-0.024209255,0.09655345,0.13836522,-0.043516524,0.06817207,0.22756588,0.31722286,0.07596803,0.087326944,0.035232797,-0.017931027,-0.044766296,0.03655212,0.06633327,0.034836866,0.00017249491,0.17240271,0.11758065,0.09215839,0.086361945,0.035087436,0.010047745,0.05736272,0.14924955,0.18802202,0.05757136,0.16524574,0.08355528,-0.0030051991,0.0398946,0.06252649,-0.023404725,-0.084532864,0.010250019,0.21589527,0.16097254,0.15226279,0.038124718,0.040562093,0.00828944,0.06469341,0.061762903,0.14840215,0.029376123,-0.010352838,0.11850658,0.2424337,0.08870193,0.18386364,0.10820318,0.13829422,0.31836444,0.17687413,0.14576477,0.17763753,-0.07470993,-0.025785407,-0.068167046,-0.09398082,-0.03511002,0.020911098,0.057549026,0.04750385,0.12067101,0.09070806,0.08729245,0.023090672,0.10469795,0.04656778,0.030506402,-0.02612035,0.08718321,0.14377445,-0.054969486,-0.09270672,-0.033052243,-0.028081499,-0.07769382,-0.018541731,0.046288256,0.15697259,0.042942084,-0.028459337,-0.0635195,-0.018595127,-0.040324952,0.005859418,-0.10046964,0.0024583116,-0.06508292,0.03592158
"The most important values in my life are putting family first and living a genuine life. That means being kind and honest towards people, and valuing the people closest to me. The things that guide those principles are my upbringing by my parents, and my religious background as a christian. My parents instilled in me the importance of honesty and kindness, and that your family will always be there to support you when you need them. Honesty is important because it is important that people value and trust your words and your actions.","In the past seven days, I have made my bed, wrote emails, cooked dinner, lifted weights and did cardio on the treadmill at the gym. I have also gone to the store to purchase a new phone, and went to a doctors appointment. I also went to church, watched a movie with my friends, and spent a great deal of time studying.

"One value that guides my life is my commitment to my family and friends. Family comes first to me, and they are super important to my wellbeing. I would say another value is faith, which guides my life morally and provides a purpose for me as I navigate life. It also makes me a better person and have better relationships with those around me. I am a Christian and my faith has given me so much joy.","This past week I worked monday through friday. My normal work day includes waking up and having my coffee while I check emails. Then I usually have my morning meetings and start cracking down on work tasks. I eat lunch around noon and continue work. I logoff around 5-6pm in which I have happy hour with my family. We then make and have dinner, after which we watch TV until bed. I usually read before bed. This past weekend I went to Cape Cod with my family.

"My main principal in life is to live the type of life that God would have me to live.  To strive in everything that I do to be the type of person that Jesus was and is.  To be kind to all people, to treat people in the way that I would like to be treated, to not say hurtful things to people.. either close family and friends, or to perfect strangers.  To strive to be helpful to people who are in far worse circumstance.. to give back.  To be of help to family and friends when they are in need.. either financially or just to lend an ear.","Well, for the past 7 days I have done quite a few things.  On several occasions, I have gone out Christmas shopping.  Some of the stores that I have gone to are Macys, Dillards, TJ Maxx/HomeGoods, At Home, Home Depot, Target, and Hobby Lobby.  I was searching for additional Christmas decorations for the house, indoors and outdoors, and also, for a few Christmas presents.  I have also been to the Grocery Store several times, getting things that i needed to prepare dinner.  A couple of days ago, I decided to prepare Swedish meatballs and noodles for my husband.. as it is one of his favorites.  He loved it!  Also, my husband and I took a little trek up to the Outlet Mall... about an hour from here.  Today, I had breakfast with my son at one of our favorite Cafes..

"The most important values in my life are those that define me as an individual. By this I mean the things that I am and I want to be. So, specifically, this is being intelligent and analytical, being fair, being intellectual, being innovative and wanting to try new things, being artistic, and being active. I try to evaluate difficult situations by finding the actions that best accord with these principles. So, for instance, if I am faced with a decision that affects other I try to choose what is fairest and not what is best for me. Or if I need to resist temptation/make a decision as to what I want to do with my life going forward, I evaluate what will accord best with my values as above; a specific example of the latter would be when I'm struggling with eating healthily. There are many times I feel the temptation to eat poorly because of the short-term pleasure, but by evaluating what is important to me, I am able to resist the temptation.","Starting exactly one week ago I woke up, walked my dogs, ate breakfast and went for a walk in the earlier half of the day. I spent the rest of the day reading and hanging out, and walking my dogs a few times. Last weekend I was mostly at home: this consisted of caring for and playing with my dogs, exercising, eating, reading and generally relaxing. I ordered food one night last weekend. This previous week I mostly studied. I took care of my dogs. It was pretty uneventful. I exercised Monday and Tuesday but I was not very good about exercising the rest of the week. I did go for some walks. I ate dinner with my family some nights.

"Truth and justice come to mind first. They are the beacons in my life which guide me through the darkest times. In the current state of affairs they are more important than ever because society has lost all notions of either of these principles. 
If one is not true to themself then who really are they? Truth gives us a foundation to stand on and enables us to look in the mirror and be happy with what we see. Truth is something that while it may not be favorable in the end it attracts people to you because people want to know that a person is someone who believes in something and doesn't just pander and cater to whatever is trending. 
Justice is what nature intends. While justice is rarely seen these days the natural order of things still must stand on this principle. I want whats deserved for myself and others.","One activity I have engaged in is back rehabilitation. My back has gotten so bad that I fear it is just turning into dust.

"The biggest and most important values that I try to follow everyday is to be kind and understanding to everyone I deal with because you never know what they are going through. I try to be honest about everything in my life because I don't like to be lied to. To treat people the way you would like to be treated. To not try and judge someone by their looks, I wouldn't want someone to do that to me. I try and do what's right, I listen to my heart and god. I also try to teach my kids to be the same and to help anyone that needs help no matter the circumstance.","I regularly take care of my animals, I have to water, feed and make sure their home is comfortable. I clean house, wash dishes, laundry, and cook meals. I spend time with my kids and family, and just try to talk and spend as much time with them as I can. I also like to spend time with my son doing things we both enjoy like trapping, hunting, fishing, welding, working on motors, and building things. I also make sure to make time for myself just to stay true to myself.

"My values are about being kind. When I'm trying to work out a difficult decision I consider all angles of it first, and settle on the best possible outcome for myself in the long-run. I try to do right by the people in my life, either by listening or helping out if I can.","Last week I tried to go out to dinner with a friend but several roads and businesses were closed because of a Christmas parade, including the place where we needed to pick up our food. We were lost in a strange neighborhood for about thirty-five minutes. My friend is an excellent driver and we eventually made it out. I more or less re-lived the experience for many days afterward and made up my mind to never leave the house again. I rarely go anywhere because of my disability. I fell in the middle of the night maybe five days after that incident. I'm alright, but i've become very depressed. I still carry on with my daily routines, including making myself dinner and doing some light cleaning. I haven't done laundry in almost two weeks and I need to. My dad will be staying with me soon for Christmas. I haven't gotten to do much of anything I've wanted except watch a little TV. I never make my bed. I shower every other day but only wash my hair once a week or so.

"I am disabled and had to discontinue work seven years ago. It was a very stressful time for me. My mother was also diagnosed with late-stage cancer and needed someone to be with her as my Dad had recently passed away. It worked out well because I needed a place to go while filing for disability and I wanted to help her. Even though I was no longer able to be in a work environment I wanted to be able to help others if possible. I still am doing that to this day. This is what is important in my life as I am involved in a chat group with others that have issues and I am there to be supportive. At times it has not been easy however I have stayed because it also helps me as well to feel a sense of companionship so this helps me feel strong as I am alone but not lonely. I feel very fortunate for each person for being there and I feel I have helped to make it what it is. We have supported each other in many ways such as emotional that has been much needed these past few years, especially with the pandemic and being in the house so much. I feel proud of this.","I took a shower and colored my hair. I also talked with my brother and we had a very hurtful disagreement about something but then we were able to work it out which I now feel so much better about. This took place through a brief phone call where he hung up on me and several emails later. Of course, I ate my dinners. I usually eat two meals a day, take long naps watch a lot of TV.  I am on my computer a lot as well because I love to read and I do surveys and play video games. I did an online order of my groceries that were delivered.

"I value honesty and loyalty.

I have to be able to trust someone in order to interact with them on a regular basis. Most people tell the truth most of the time, but most will also tell a lie if the benefits to them are high enough. An honest person will always tell the truth.

Loyalty is crucial for deep relationships in my opinion. When you commit to any sort of relationship, you are making yourself vulnerable, and if you someone isn't loyal, they will make you hurt.

","I simped for girls really hard these past 7 days. My bank account is down a thousand dollars and I have nothing to show for it. I fed my cat multiple times a day because she eats the perfect portions. I found a big trash bag, so I've been able to condense the trash into it. I was playing a JRPG, but I got bored, so I haven't turned on my PS5 in a few days at least. It's kind of dusty, but as I rarely play it, I haven't the motivation to take it apart and clean it. I'm a sad dude.",3.333333333333333,3.8333333333333335,3.1666666666666665,1.3333333333333333,2.333333333333333,2.5,4.0,2.5,4.5,5.5,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0,2.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,5.0,12,3.0,4.0,4.166666666666667,2,29,1,English,2,4,R_3ezxeWC3o3C628x,-0.07565458,-0.015204497,0.1620194,0.1518656,0.044772077,0.20861924,0.029824445,-0.027127046,0.10945709,0.16767189,0.02529847,0.11462528,0.013984304,0.11802483,-0.014600322,0.016504131,0.076410644,0.077105016,0.04275562,-0.065779306,-0.019377835,0.07630039,0.10018256,-0.044784263,0.0065222224,0.13988325,0.11440564,-0.018796902,-0.060906626,0.063998505,0.1831981,0.20416303,0.17342873,0.11436431,0.059947394,-0.06350387,0.028698403,-0.055337306,-0.07906947,-0.08992043,-0.034973085,0.22089082,0.09577138,0.1841434,0.031272404,-0.02094303,0.0065507647,0.051486608,0.053897254,0.1138643,0.049621545,0.015165239,0.2097581,0.21014132,0.1556645,0.12778172,0.0759891,0.089071624,0.24444093,0.13439421,0.15879731,0.13566408,0.0088492185,-0.033019282,0.028666671,0.021714589,0.08857724,0.07587318,0.14465368,0.053535365,0.12870128,0.15110062,0.033660892,0.1561482,0.16437714,0.04108411,-0.04062762,-0.02606315,0.059692252,0.19694844,-0.057613567,0.0045247925,0.03149201,-0.079594865,0.020364434,-0.04549304,-0.034537945,0.066654116,-0.0019943323,0.05487393,-0.050592102,0.012643215,-0.03184624,0.05005669,0.036689736,0.014523259,0.021888664,0.04441929
"My central and most important values are guided by the saying ""To thine own self be true.""  I believe in living an authentic life.  I am always attempting to work through my conditioning and trauma to become the most authentic version of myself.  I believe in mindfulness.  I use mindfulness to help me get through difficult moments and to live in the present moment.  I was not taught how to deal with my emotions and that became a huge challenge when I became an adult.  I am highly interested in psychology and why people behave the way they do.  I've learned that this heightened sense of curiosity comes from the fact that I always felt hyper-aware of my mother's emotions.  She was not verbally affectionate and communicating with her was difficult as a child.  Not only was there a language barrier because she's from South Korea but she wasn't taught how to deal with her emotions either.  This naturally trickled down to me and I was always walking on eggshells around her mood swings as a child.  I had to manage her moods and this later became a strength and curse for me as an adult.  I'm a Myers Brigg's INFJ.  I have a very strong intuition and notice patterns in people automatically.  I had to learn how to use this as a gift rather than a curse.  It was hard to manage in my relationships once I got older but with conscious awareness and practice, I have been able to use mindfulness to use it to my advantage.","A week ago from today, I was working from home.  I also ate cooked and ate dinner.  The next day I woke up and prepared myself for the day.  I also worked from home.  I skipped breakfast, ate lunch, and also prepared dinner that day. I watched television and played with my dog.  The next day I picked up my daughter from the airport because she was visiting home from college.  We stopped by her favorite fast food restaurant on the way home.  We talked about all the things she missed while away at college.  When we got home she ate a prepared meal made just for her.  The next day I got up and prepared myself for work. I worked from home.  My mother cooked my daughter's favorite meal and we all ate that for lunch.  The next few days involved me getting up and preparing for my work day.  I worked from home the entire week. I also balanced my time to spend time with my daughter.  I cooked her favorite meals such as pasta salad, tacos, and Korean dishes. We went to the grocery store on Monday to buy some food and snacks for her.  Today I'm working from home and also working on MTurk.  I ate spaghetti for lunch today.

"My life values ​​are very simple, try to help others as much as possible, always try to improve and define short and long-term projects, whether they are financial projects, professional projects, for personal fun (like a new sport) and other internal projects (such as cleaning my home, maintenance of personal equipment such as car, lawn mower). I like to organize my time according to the things that have priority.

"I try to live by the oft repeated, but rarely actualized, motto of treat people how you want to be treated. I have seen many people in life treat others as if they are beneath them or owe them something, but when the time comes and they don't get the treatment they want they are upset. I think treating people how you would like to be treated is something that comes true because others see how you act. People can see how you behave and how you treat people, and if you are kind and generous they will likely be that same way towards you. I also know that if you are unkind or rude to someone, you should be ready to accept that same treatment back. How you treat people is a show of respect for other people and a show of respect for yourself as well. How you treat other people is how much respect you have for them and if you want this treatment back, how much respect you have for yourself.","This week has been a relatively quiet one for me, as I have been trying to avoid my interactions with others until I have gotten my vaccine booster shot. Starting on Sunday I did my laundry and household cleaning chores, and them I watched my favorite shows while eating dinner and went to sleep to work from home the next day. From Monday through to Thursday (yesterday) I worked from home. I got up, ate a small breakfast, worked through meetings and then had lunch, and then finished my work day. I cooked myself dinner every day this week (instead of getting food delivered) and spent time with my dog while exercising and going for runs. I then got ready for bed after watching a few of my favorite shows and then went to sleep. It has been a quiet and regimented week, if not somewhat boring. I sometimes enjoy having a strict and regular schedule, and this is one of those weeks.",3.8333333333333335,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,1.1666666666666667,3.5,3.8333333333333335,4.0,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,5.0,5,3.333333333333333,1.5,3.1666666666666665,2,33,4,English,3,6,R_0jpE9Zb0EsVAHo5,0.06099735,-0.025417903,0.12529007,0.040827796,0.1471661,0.14173137,0.057103705,0.07188115,0.119676955,0.09717913,-0.010356609,0.04056113,0.29320621,0.31854987,0.14577603,0.08580463,0.04846258,0.034879554,-0.079337485,0.030015148,0.024718996,0.0003323052,-0.007068025,0.01374432,-0.0068714023,0.0034971088,0.024972769,0.02165829,-0.013884833,-0.041685887,0.14602236,0.11831676,0.06321855,0.10529296,0.029920086,0.010698211,0.059780627,0.06531847,-0.05436088,0.031644873,0.035839036,0.144766,0.04799294,-0.0033972189,0.010478642,-0.04436183,0.06453695,-0.01726288,0.017286751,0.08692571,0.015398968,0.06225411,0.11748046,0.14435603,0.12352337,0.20051342,0.071747705,0.07143843,0.24628617,0.025224414,0.12585011,0.10638079,0.0044185705,-0.007882753,0.008694075,0.10665822,0.12889478,0.13635743,-0.079658926,-0.05099067,-0.01342597,-0.06349872,0.06216714,0.008515589,0.035915103,-0.04809267,0.050351664,0.011797049,0.023587035,0.17948504,-0.10856284,-0.057791248,-0.033128887,-0.017734844,-0.03420675,-0.022826884,-0.11069388,0.074784905,-0.012011007,0.004940303,-0.1072529,-0.021545447,-0.03962409,-0.081504434,-0.008452063,0.057130255,-0.04621628,-0.05658767
"My most central values that guide my life are, my parents number one, and overall the teachings they have taught me over the years. For one, my father has always taught me to work hard and to work for myself, and that in life nothing is easy but it will take hard work and a lot of time. He has always taught me that there's always a solution for everything in life no matter the circumstances. If there are any problems in life, he has taught me that no matter how tough life is, that life will keep moving. When I have made some of the most difficult decisions I have always asked for his advice and has always been straightforward and pretty much everything that he has taught me in life has been straight forward. When I have dealt with difficult things in my life that is how I have continued life. I said ""Its happened there is nothing else I can do, life goes on"" An example of this, is for example, accidentally dropping my phone and it breaking it. It is replaceable. My father has always told me, ""everything IS irreplaceable, except life"". While we hold on to material things, every one of those material things will always be replaceable. But our very lives are not. These are the values that I have lived by. And the values are integrity, honesty, hard work, focus, patience, and straightforwardness. There is a solution for everything and in life. And there is always a better tomorrow.","In the past seven days, I mostly have been on my computer working, doing several Mturk tasks continuously with a few meal breaks in between. But during those meal breaks, I watch Youtube, I listen to Christmas music to get into the holiday spirit, and I am also searching for Christmas gifts for family. All while planning for the new year. I have also been watching random videos on youtube, and seeing what is trending or is there to see. During these meal breaks I also check the news. And try and see what future events are ahead. Because of Christmas being so close this why I have been working almost religiously to be able to have a little extra money on the side to buy gifts. But I have gotten actually addicted to working as much as I can. And I do think this will continue on to the new year.",4.666666666666667,4.833333333333333,4.166666666666667,3.5,4.833333333333333,3.8333333333333335,4.0,4.333333333333333,5.5,1.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,5.0,1.5,5.0,14,3.1666666666666665,4.0,3.1666666666666665,2,30,1,English,156,3,R_ZzbRGYWzaDqDhYt,0.012050882,0.122958094,0.11350551,0.14030719,0.08980025,0.20162909,-0.036040686,0.12296897,0.19650973,0.14850226,0.025461199,0.15339768,0.24778752,0.34839344,0.12075353,0.20475814,0.24007587,-0.058621205,-0.03777609,0.014729741,0.14973605,0.08324859,-0.07725422,0.057019435,0.08487455,0.08472535,0.15228282,-0.008182317,0.04466762,0.021751389,0.11997235,0.15993349,0.22612572,0.219562,0.16185002,0.016692223,0.033326462,0.027039591,-0.026025018,0.0025696196,0.012719277,0.32042342,0.08125605,0.24157795,0.11749694,-0.03145824,0.14892942,0.025392324,0.2209695,0.22544438,0.054495983,0.043488808,0.2842982,0.26785362,0.12067399,0.20912334,0.16481332,0.23812675,0.30952698,0.2123991,0.15529521,0.07467398,0.056663834,0.025925286,-0.0013505928,0.051625468,0.06999346,0.09643344,0.116920136,0.13392065,0.15632203,0.13994876,0.15597293,0.20808691,0.22506082,0.16025297,0.11796942,0.10361139,0.06278628,0.118752085,-0.10612573,-0.01797774,0.0050263843,-0.12612854,0.018403236,-0.039222535,0.14437279,0.23153973,0.03432875,0.08900514,-0.054196846,0.04091435,-0.018784653,0.07804977,-0.07787986,0.024983594,0.022485115,-0.030194217
"determination - I have had this all of my life. I am always determined to reach goals I set. 
compassion - I am a compassionate person, and care deeply about my family. 
forgiveness - this one is a big one. I always forgive, and trust me, people have needed a lot of forgiveness around me in my lifetime. 
empathy - I always try to put myself in my family's shoes, namely my kids, to understand better what they may be going through and their life difficulties

Monday we took our two savannah cats and our parrot to the exotic veterinarian, and the cats did not behave, and always require sedation to be examined. That night, I met my youngest teenage child at the hair salon, for a haircut and color. Tuesday I worked 9a-12p and 5p-8p, which I hate because I work on the phone, and that's a lot of hours on the phone. I worked out with a P-90X DVD, shoulders and arms. Wednesday I worked 9a-1p, and then met both of my teenage children for a doctor's appointment. I used my three leg workout machines, and rode the recumbent bike for 30 minutes.

There is a simple reason for that: it works. And from personal experience, it works well.

Perhaps you want to get started, but you tell yourself, or your busy mind tells you, that you just don’t have the time to sit around and meditate during the day. My first piece of advice is to take the time to observe your mind from an outside perspective and simply be in the moment. That is what meditation is all about. But this isn’t an article about meditation.

Despite what you think, meditating is not the only way to be mindful. My next piece of advice is to be mindful in your day-to-day activities. You can experience a meditative and mindful state merely by giving complete attention and awareness to the things you are doing in the present moment.",4.0,3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.166666666666667,3.5,2.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,4.5,6.0,5.666666666666668,5.5,5.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,16,4.166666666666667,1.0,4.333333333333333,2,35,1,English,2,3,R_30u70sRPH5VycUS,0.0064051487,0.17868331,0.042118512,-0.0058933143,0.07511586,0.05340237,-0.0074775964,0.058497585,0.111648574,0.024985678,0.035047624,0.13680843,0.12882033,0.38212687,0.19604468,0.16120204,0.2089755,-0.06439456,0.0033821785,-0.02038518,0.04643216,-0.025695601,-0.07353731,0.02834966,-0.04396014,0.007393077,-0.026757678,-0.02551509,-0.023108255,0.035844207,0.22134987,0.16370732,0.2662567,0.098667935,0.2482158,0.047802553,0.11515568,0.012095977,0.060382143,-0.032360684,0.044016015,0.2856005,0.035457022,0.11720231,0.113754146,-0.031170107,0.13229018,0.12104333,0.22411528,0.10430746,0.1517495,0.10637559,0.08579899,0.14159085,0.08241342,0.22765926,0.11722006,0.13622338,0.2298992,0.19726223,0.06826815,0.026220981,0.20314401,0.17103526,0.08343652,0.14854012,0.18240528,0.10550979,-0.071358494,-0.1329438,0.02033211,-0.043701958,0.004182948,-0.06513034,-0.044237945,-0.028914092,-0.0478047,0.031894334,0.0021635583,0.119188644,-0.073545605,-0.056014158,-0.04297444,0.01414115,0.015685227,-0.10352516,0.04074071,0.14585583,0.08280778,0.08448513,-0.01889294,0.010010887,0.101307966,0.07935916,-0.06204604,-0.03850596,0.040598,-0.02396128
"I remember being a baby.  I knew no words.  All I could do was move my head and my eyes.  Every once in a while I would see ""my"" foot kick and I'd think (not in words but in impressions) what's up with that?  Oddly my inabilities were not a source of consternation to me then.  After all I no idea what to expect from.  Having a body with physical senses was brand new to me.  I had a certain patience about the whole situaton, like All would be revealed in the fullness of time.  I loved to hear my parents talk in the next room though I had no idea what they were saying.   But I knew how to pray. And it was easy(after all if it were difficult it would be essentially impossible for me).  If anyone had taught me about God I wouldn't have understood them (not in words anyway).  But KNEW there was a God.  And the concept of a name or names was alien to me.  And in an especially anxious moment I turned to God in prayer when I noticed my mother wasn't coming to see me.  And he answered that prayer a few days later.  I was praying for my mother who (unbeknowst to me then) was dying of viral pneumonia (and that's why she didn't come to see me).  And (also unbeknownst to me) her doctor had given her an experimental medicine that would either kill her or cure her.  And (also unbeknowst to me) she came home an decided to take it and it cured her.  I only later found out these things from my mother decades later.  And she said ""And then I could come and see you again !"".  Almighty God is close to me.  And he loves me, and you, too.","I had spent 17 days in the hospital.  And 7 days ago I was sent home to recuperate from cardiac surgery (a new valve).  I have other health issues that I was so afraid would make it difficult for me to get out of the Uber ride.  But I became aware that the driver was a Christian.  So I asked her to pray for me as I got out of the vehicle, which she did.  Getting out was surprisingly easy.  And opening the lock with my brass key around my neck into a brass lock was also quite easy (perhaps a first for me because they tend to get gummy with corrosion).  I opened it up got her a tip and thanked her for praying for me as I believe so much could've gone wrong but did.  I'm rather poor and my insurance didn't cover rehab centers (I reckon) so they sent me home.  At first I was in bad shape (weak and sore) but happy to be home.  But my strength grew and the soreness faded.  Now my battle is with the bills.  (overcharging that should've been covered by Medicare A).  I been learning about the effects of a protein deficiency and about a potassium deficiency and well as how to prevent constipation (for a while there I wondered if I had an obstructed bowel, but by the grace of God I had a good movement yesterday (I think) after 3 weeks without one.  Sometimes I'm afraid that I might be overwhelmed by a sea of medical bills and lose my home only to die of exposure by the side of the road.  But all things do work together for good to them that love the Lord and are called for his purposes.  I don't know the future.  I have many abilities (by the grace of God) that might be useful.  For decades I've taken the security of this nation as a personal responsibility, not an organizational responsibility of mine.  I believe (perhaps out of vanity) that my abilities of strategic planning and new analysis and other things are so special, so refined that to subject them to a chain of command would diminish them.  Perhaps that's hubris.  Perhaps that's not God's calling for me.  But I know this much: no amount of cold hard math, no human skill alone, is sufficient to win victory neither in a modern conflict nor in ancient times.  Divine inspiration can fill in the gaps when the cold hard math falls short.  Perhaps the nature of conflict itself makes that inevitable, i.e. that victory belongs as much to the greatest prophets, the greatest seers and the greatest military.  Perhaps now as long ago conflict is as much about the journey of the human soul and the search for truth as anything else.

"Some of the most important values to me include responsibility, wisdom, liberty, independence, self-reliance, resilience, and self-reflection. I really try to gain a little bit of wisdom every day, and pass it on when appropriate. I take pride in being self-reliant and resilient, and that I am able to do things and make decisions on my own. I am proud of what I have overcome and how strong those things have made me. I live and breathe independent thinking, and try to encourage it in others, as I dislike being simply reactionary. I try to arrive at my decisions and opinions after thorough self-reflection and research, and tend not to follow crowds in most cases unless our values happen to overlap. Ultimately, I believe in liberty and responsibility, two sides of the same coin. I must be responsible if I want liberty, and there is freedom to be found in being responsible.","In the last week, I have done many of the same things day to day: feeding the dogs and horses, cooking for the kids, making my bed, logging in to work, homeschooling the kids, doing dishes. Some other chores I have done around the house include sweeping and mopping, doing several loads of laundry, and cleaning out the horse pens. I have logged into work for 5 days in a row, and completed surveys on MTurk every day for at least an hour. I have cooked several meals, including macaroni and cheese, pork chops and couscous, spaghetti with meat sauce, and have made up several skillets of popcorn for the kids and I. I dropped the kids off for a day with their dad as well. I helped my dad hang a new TV on a wall mount. I have wrapped a lot of Christmas presents, and done a little online shopping. I got my first COVID shot this week. I took the kids to a bookstore as well. I also wrote an article for my freelance job, and then completed a book review for the same job this morning. I have talked with a few friends, and went out to dinner with my cousin and spent an hour on the phone with my aunt. Finally, I attended a 4h meeting wiht my boys and my dad for the first time to check it out and see if they were interested.",3.333333333333333,1.0,4.333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,1.1666666666666667,4.5,2.333333333333333,6.0,3.5,4.333333333333333,5.0,2.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,5,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.333333333333333,1,33,6,English,1,6,R_2pWFe7yq4FCyZW7,-0.019271728,0.036716133,0.2048717,0.11691786,0.013958365,0.25216377,0.005190149,0.025248125,0.16097793,0.07463387,-0.052119546,0.07539636,0.09364338,0.2240724,0.06289922,0.103559,0.09416149,-0.026448641,-0.013581131,-0.0032396242,-0.0035302863,0.07950631,0.044107333,0.017229194,-0.018126193,0.15726401,0.11358204,0.12982765,0.01388443,-0.001282014,0.17137933,0.16800092,0.12161662,0.16998893,0.1257796,-0.04915655,-0.020366184,-0.04436829,-0.08959806,-0.08671759,-0.06809003,0.2800493,0.09983365,0.10850616,0.06753409,-0.099903315,-0.0451072,-0.016997097,0.12096156,0.185929,-0.0008830037,0.013147762,0.12910625,0.2125307,0.0964733,0.18623388,0.07495648,0.14777772,0.28318644,0.1261373,0.18072055,0.10602231,0.003833603,-0.0134873,-0.058368087,0.02421069,-0.008621206,0.031379536,0.07346074,0.06326362,0.100989215,0.057706706,0.088109404,0.08075017,0.115019225,0.039146766,0.1044724,0.003740795,0.052300714,0.09618888,0.0013801549,-0.04471463,-0.041862816,-0.06505719,-0.03229893,-0.04862906,-0.047667217,0.12123529,0.09943542,0.016986448,0.013613071,-0.006372492,-0.11749008,-0.03482119,-0.11382299,-0.048373234,-0.059521046,-0.05858917
"One of my core values is accepting people without judgement, as much as possible. I value having a nonjudgmental attitude. This value has been important in my work as a child and family therapist. Counseling doesn't work well if the therapist is judgmental toward the client. This is crucial when working with teens. Teens pick up on any type of judgement quickly and easily. I have also imparted this value to my kids and they have grown into adult who are nonjudgement as well as people who advocate for those struggling to be accepting in society. I also believe in compassion. We all have our stories and compassion allows us to connect as humans, though we may be different, politically or culturally, for example. I have been able to meet some amazing people by opening myself up and feeling compassion and empathy. I have been able to connect with strangers, if only through  brief conversations, in a deep way. This has added meaning to my life.","About a week ago, I helped a good friend of mine unpack boxes. She has moved into a new apartment and was feeling overwhelmed. We also found her Christmas tree and put that up and hung ornaments. By the time we were done, she felt much better about her apartment as it was much less cluttered. I have provided emotional support in different ways to my 2 sons who are college students. I listen to concerns about finals and have answered some apartment questions as my youngest just moved into his own apartment. I have kept up my trail running regularly. I run every other day out in the mountains. Now it's winter and snowing, and it's really beautiful. I run with cleats so I don't fall in the ice and snow, but it's really refreshing. Today it was 16 out when I ran. I got charged by a barking dog, but he calmed down.",4.833333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,1.1666666666666667,4.5,1.8333333333333333,5.5,1.0,6.0,1.0,3.5,3.0,1.5,3.5,3.5,6.0,5,3.5,1.0,3.6666666666666665,1,56,6,English,1,6,R_7R49dcMNPU28SD7,0.015580399,-0.020833047,0.09275848,0.051214203,0.15074167,0.112186596,0.031062193,0.06662677,0.11913468,0.08249853,-0.015072431,0.07520897,0.06535333,0.11890663,0.02512895,0.05995655,0.037948743,-0.048055094,-0.004791821,-0.04522632,-0.049769565,0.10251727,0.058659367,-0.08818899,-0.049017362,0.008618511,-0.03737214,-0.00070135016,0.013196625,-0.07425114,0.12070843,0.013901575,0.085553184,0.053015873,-0.028881151,-0.020340819,0.06107476,0.007397283,-0.04999214,0.03419282,-0.011704303,0.054100208,0.04729699,-0.066157356,0.0148085095,-0.033800855,0.005539287,0.090779275,0.03075963,0.042816862,0.10466877,0.06248519,0.07533453,0.100305684,0.1411067,0.12921754,0.07232877,0.05845255,0.14809874,0.0046569873,0.18145533,0.12304926,0.10556993,0.084383585,0.18794069,0.20225304,0.19678035,0.18021318,-0.02896836,-0.018750131,0.1022834,-0.038753517,0.13390678,0.059902005,0.020334283,-0.0067013167,0.0005501525,0.008671455,-0.00041257404,0.08176736,0.020104522,-0.023122288,0.006184765,-0.030607114,0.06962687,0.0959386,-0.10504732,0.045931473,0.057006963,0.060298882,0.055297744,0.05229353,0.007906582,-0.045169905,-0.084630795,0.07263738,0.010786641,-0.09283841
I have a few guiding principles in my life. Nurturing and caring for my toddler is at the top. I spend much of my time playing with her and talking with her throughout normal daily tasks. Her safety and well being are prominent. We spend a lot of time at home due to this never ending pandemic and the fact that I live in an area not taking precautions seriously. Being kind and compassionate are also important to me. This is evident in the work I do as a mental health counselor. I focus on being open and helping others improve their lives. I enjoy seeing other people do well and believe we all do better when we are taking good care of each other and our communities.,"Starting one week ago, I cleaned my home with the help of my very eager toddler. I spent time watching a series on Netflix while completing cleaning tasks. Over the weekend, I watched a few new and/or Christmas movies. I danced to toddler music videos with my daughter. We listened to music and made scotcharoos. I completed work notes. On Monday, I had a court hearing appealing a decision regarding my prior unemployment insurance claim. I picked up a free toddler toy listed on Marketplace. I worked via telehealth for a few hours and completed an interview to add more telehealth appointments. I made a grocery order online for pick up the next morning. We picked up the grocery order. We played outside in the warm weather Wednesday until high wind took over and we had to shelter in place due to tornado warnings for a couple hours. We watched television after those warning subsided. On Thursday, I attended an online meeting to fix technical issues with my workplace platform. I fixed lunch and prepared dinner in the crockpot. So far today, we have cleaned and put together a new table.

I try to be a self sacrificing person. I know it is easy to be blinded by the things that I want but if what I want only makes me happy than I find it worthless. It is not fulfilling to be happy all alone. I also try to help people as best as I can. I like being able to give people what they need. It is really hard to maintain these values because sometimes I feel so empty and profoundly unhappy. I wish that I constantly had someone as invested in my happiness as I am for the happiness of others. I used to be very religious. I would look to God for help and support and fulfillment at all times. I want to be able to do that again but I am so out of practice.,"I have not done much over the past 7 days. I actually had to focus on me more because I caught hand/foot/mouth from my son. I had to separate myself from everyone to try to keep them safe. I have been watching shows on online, playing on my switch, filling out amazon turk hits (to try and offset the lack of income from not being able to go to work), masturbating, and studying for my exams that I passed yesterday. I have had nothing to do except what I wanted to, and now I feel so empty. I have not even had the energy or motivation to continuing to do whatever struck my fancy because of how lonely and unfulfilling it is.",3.8333333333333335,3.8333333333333335,3.5,2.1666666666666665,3.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,4.0,3.5,4.5,5.0,5.5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,14,3.5,5.0,3.8333333333333335,2,27,1,English,1,5,R_1r2pHu2xhC1fYw0,-0.003400568,0.09631123,0.11185518,0.19115742,0.13584942,0.2745206,0.020145537,0.07589826,0.16683309,0.06974579,0.06890935,0.21361795,0.15695098,0.29515472,0.2059112,0.17912896,0.18999557,0.051238496,0.011018954,0.00088998675,0.048440844,0.0896075,-0.02692585,0.019965101,-0.024465289,-0.016162887,0.06512246,-0.020099802,0.04657634,0.01748465,0.16780102,0.22110096,0.20276779,0.16414751,0.1761275,-0.043846786,0.0019452684,-0.10046331,-0.067659184,-0.057481386,-0.072362825,0.26747853,0.15762937,0.17519188,0.100747615,-0.076085344,0.11867142,0.043515638,0.21863392,0.22702585,0.05505009,0.003670752,0.117927745,0.3057223,0.11264036,0.22205427,0.1798918,0.16526279,0.28460222,0.26981986,0.16959715,0.13321708,0.13053228,0.03054804,0.09851588,0.2556457,0.10302946,0.21014291,0.038898706,0.02772885,0.102906615,0.032341838,0.05209638,0.00757418,0.014449041,0.016078392,-0.051904764,0.08837141,0.004889382,0.21667555,-0.100514516,0.0071169976,0.0252798,-0.07488981,0.0792545,-0.029400622,-0.030416317,0.05806608,0.04255448,0.10171294,-0.076585054,-0.0018498255,-0.029643517,0.005214963,-0.07942976,0.05977702,-0.037190177,0.047832906

"Being creative is something I cherish. I don't get to do something everyday, but I do love to do it. I love to sew, draw, paint, collage, sing, play music, dance. I'm not claiming I am very good at any of them, but I love doing it. I try to set aside time to devote to projects. I like making the time sacred. I connect with my innerself and that flow state.","I started a new embroidery project. I have this oddly-colored paisly print cotton fabric. I put a scrap of it in a small embroidery hoop and decided to experiment with embellishing the design printed on the fabric. I started with a black fuzzy floss. It says wool on it's label but I seriously doubt it is real wool. For the price I paid it is more likely to be acrylic than wool. Also, I've never seen wool sold before as stranded embroidery floss. But I started with one strand of the black and followed the outline with backstitches. When I ran out of that strand, I tried doing the same thing with a brown sewing thread. . The black floss was thicker than the printed line I was following and it looked bolder and darker with the thick floss. The brown thread was not quite as thick as the line I was following. Also, the brown was lighter than the black line printed on the fabric. The brown complimented the warm red on the print and the off-white of the background. I thought the brown thread looked muted but very nice on the print.",5.0,5.0,2.1666666666666665,2.5,2.833333333333333,1.3333333333333333,3.1666666666666665,3.333333333333333,5.0,2.5,5.666666666666668,2.5,4.5,3.5,5.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,6,3.8333333333333335,2.0,2.833333333333333,1,54,6,English,1,5,R_3R8CDO7jAV23z7K,-0.040448558,-0.09989053,-0.0038521215,0.026260935,0.021083001,0.058390312,-0.07497081,-0.046062037,-0.009229273,0.0028477572,0.022271141,-0.060146376,-0.15596335,-0.14540653,-0.044802923,-0.054763086,-0.06988769,0.04669018,-0.037790596,-0.055950128,-0.052220225,0.010956053,-0.005421317,0.019949522,0.03065953,-0.033226527,0.01720732,-0.0039972253,-0.0014893096,-0.039765995,-0.030315215,0.060981408,0.07609717,-0.01171609,0.034471355,-0.11281249,-0.06883338,-0.12027558,-0.12328858,-0.047811925,-0.09789353,0.034138538,-0.017475441,-0.05634696,-0.07350762,-0.063586794,-0.057055313,-0.068096586,-0.022166122,-0.03606067,-0.12558436,-0.07497121,0.027423013,-0.06980003,-0.049838495,-0.061015025,-0.06668143,0.013832595,0.00071068667,-0.056734428,0.009076053,-0.033057626,-0.060548853,-0.04835502,-0.065137096,-0.02696653,0.01734262,-0.026592433,-0.028528038,-0.029319188,-0.030260362,-0.052539345,-0.043969102,-0.023701154,-0.006324144,-0.026963368,0.045148157,-0.028549608,-0.013047647,-0.051653154,-0.053507544,-0.03589455,-0.027850881,-0.09111433,0.051018484,0.038953923,-0.007914249,-0.031101605,-0.06132508,-0.10545261,-0.104760304,-0.09195496,-0.0020174198,-0.028307935,-0.07464349,0.12542377,0.035470016,-0.077425614
"That one is easy for me.  You see, I had an afterlife experience, and even though I was resentful about having to come back for about twenty years, I came to accept the fact that I had to stay here for a reason.

Though the years, I have come across people who are either struggling with their faith, have lost or about to lose a loved one or facing death themselves.  I haven't really sought them out but when the opportunity arises, I love to share my story and assure them (straight from someone who isn't necessarily a 'bible thumper'), that we really do indeed go on to another level of existence after we leave our lives here, so they shouldn't be afraid.

I try to remind people on facebook, as I have hundreds of followers, to be kind, and morally kind and faithful to themselves and higher ideals.  So that is my mission now.","Well, I am retired, so I really don't do a lot every day. 

The big thing that happened in the last seven days was that 6 days ago, we finally got our furnace repaired.  It had been out for about two weeks.  

After that was taken care of, I have a cat that has a skin problem, so I have been researching ways to address it without continuing to give him the vet prescribed meds. 

I am disabled too, so most of my days consist of watching TV, cooking, taking care of my physical needs and doing these surveys to help round out my budget so my fixed income will be enough.

I usually spend my days eating drinking and sleeping. I spend my time with my mom and my dogs now that my father has passed away.  I spent some time this past week praying to god and praying for my father. I took my dogs out on a small walk this week as well. I spent some time playing my favorite video game Runescape online.

"My main value is to help and not hurt and to try to make people's life better.  This is my goal both at work, where I am a librarian, and outside of work, where I try to make people's lives better in any way I can, even it it's little things like paying for someone's lunch in the car behind me at the drive-thru or helping out charitable and volunteer organizations. I used to volunteer more often before I had to move.  Now I spend most of my free time driving the 6-hour round trip to my mother's every weekend to help her around the house and to spend time with my niece and nephew who lost their mom a few years ago.","On Monday I went to work.  I cataloged and processed books.  Then I went home and worked on cleaning my house.  On Tuesday I worked late, managing inter-library loans and cataloging and processing books.  On Wednesday I worked, managing inter-library loans and cataloging and processing books, but took off work 30 minutes early so I could run some errands, get the laundry caught up. and finish cleaning my house so I could drive down to my mom's for our family Christmas this weekend.

"My most important values are compassion, fairness, and multicultural justice.  I am very focused on the sufferings and ill treatment of the less fortunate in society and minorities.  I try to do extra things for people in these categories, hoping to give them support.  I believe we live in a very unjust, unequal society where the rich and powerful are above the law and can manipulate our political system.  Because of this, I strive to do things for the downtrodden who have almost no voice in our unfair system.  Lastly, I want to make as much difference as I can in helping people who are from multicultural backgrounds achieve acceptance and inclusion.","Over the past week, I visited my psychiatrist and psychologist for my PTSD therapies.  I had to bring my car to an auto body shop because it had been vandalized the week before.  So this week I am driving a Toyota Camry that is really great.

"My life choices and interactions are guided by my belief in God and that there are absolute Truths that I must follow. When I interact with people, I try to be kind and understanding. I follow the Golden Rule to treat others as I would want to be treated. It is important to be honest with people and, at the same time, try not to be hurtful while being honest. It is important to reach out to people in need and who are less fortunate than myself. Being an example to others and my family is important. I try to do everything at my best and with integrity. Making others happy is a goal for me.",Last week was great for me because I finalized some dental work that had been an ongoing process for many months. I enjoyed a day with my daughter and she brought her pet dog. We enjoyed our time together. My son visited me and we were able to talk and catch up on what we have been doing. I had a nice shopping trip to buy family surprises for Christmas. I spent some time decorating the living room with decorations for the holidays. I made a custom wreath for the door. My husband and I went for a 5 mile walk together. It was a nice time to spend with each other.,5.0,1.8333333333333333,3.8333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.166666666666667,4.166666666666667,3.1666666666666665,4.5,5.5,2.5,5.666666666666668,2.0,4.5,2.0,6.0,5.5,2.0,5.0,22,3.1666666666666665,6.0,4.166666666666667,1,64,1,English,1,5,R_1jDQjPAnqyhdzGn,0.10750386,0.08911059,0.16052815,0.035380915,0.06956981,0.16011077,0.11392856,0.17109707,0.13129242,0.1891419,-0.062314026,0.1269593,0.29891038,0.3256268,0.16814968,0.06027177,0.08263163,0.029032286,-0.04376486,0.035130113,0.11923577,0.087960854,-0.085165694,0.22220072,0.09508106,0.042397335,0.11133567,0.06914385,0.001366077,0.009102864,0.114896044,0.0849102,0.050877087,0.20984009,0.07103112,-0.10100797,0.00049087754,-0.023008814,-0.061679788,-0.12183374,-0.085752554,0.21197829,0.10623135,0.11801488,0.12991247,0.031812202,0.11318505,0.07892227,0.1477144,0.20832928,0.09070398,0.03726711,0.3935517,0.27133757,0.01909757,0.13427493,0.18484794,0.10719719,0.31620407,0.24393871,0.18970598,0.12658516,0.11819346,0.10299651,0.04245148,0.13758509,0.058171626,0.048171543,0.06482515,0.019308332,0.05098337,0.061100617,0.14394133,-0.029665202,-0.0063627698,0.0015176665,0.0069558797,0.17962718,-0.06306137,0.096926436,-0.083452255,0.0038913563,0.058211014,-0.104641214,0.051327944,0.002858901,0.059457146,0.22153209,0.043443613,0.012961337,-0.033683006,0.0107398825,0.00026068278,0.034554314,-0.076078504,0.015542682,-0.03252808,0.15176529
"The most important values that guide my life is Focus and Appreciation Being able to concentrate on a particular activity and give it our full attention. When you can “zero in” on a specific outcome, you will be successful more often than not. Refocusing your attention is all about adjusting your mental lens. Just like you can change the lens on a camera to make your target object more precise, the same thing can be done with your mind. Having the ability to improve your mind, improve your brain, and quickly and effortlessly adjust your focus on one thing will bring about the positive results you want to achieve.
Using the Law of Attraction, the primary advantage of being in the mental and emotional space of gratitude and appreciation is that it helps you to live in a reality where everything works out in your favor. You set it free to explore itself. In the silence, you begin to get the insights and the inspirations and make the connections that take you out of mind into consciousness, which is beyond reason. Being inspired, feeling gratitude, and appreciating life cannot be experienced if you are stuck in your mind.","The past 7 days, I really did not much. I worked 5 days a week. So basically all i did was tend to all my patients in the children's hospital and making sure their needs are met and provided.

Having said that, I recently retired a few months ago so in addition to the regular day to day stuff, I have spent some time getting ready for Christmas with shopping etc. I have been spending a lot of time lately trying to figure out what to do with myself in this new phase of life so I have been doing a lot of research online.

"I am very unsure of my future because life is unpredictable. Sometimes I will take risks by trusting other people, sometimes I am very cautious. I am a contradiction onto myself. I try to look for the good in people, but it is sometimes difficult. I keep my interaction at a polite, encouraging tone and try to never be rude. 
My family has raised me with some good values and I use some of them to evaluate people whom I choose to be close to. I usually do not get personally involved with co-workers because that has caused me suffering in the past. The people I trust the most usually know me best because I will be truthful to them and will seek their help to make important decisions.","I sleep a lot during the weekdays because I am usually working on Mturk HITs at night. I do take care of my pets early to mid afternoon, feeding them and letting them outside in the backyard. Some of them are older so they have a hard time moving around due to arthritis and vision issues. I do cleaning, laundry, etc. in small bursts throughout the day I am currently unemployed so I am home most of the time. When my husband gets home at around 6 or 6:30, we start dinner or order something online. Now during the weekend, my husband takes care of the pets most of the time and helps me with cleaning I didn't do during the week. I suffer from depression so sometimes during the day I don't clean or cook at all after I wake up. The weekends are spent usually running errands, grocery shopping and cleaning. I usually am texting friends throughout the day and returning calls after I wake up. We only have one car, so I cannot really travel anywhere during the week. The nearest bus stop is over a mile away. Weekends I am more relaxed and sometimes take naps during the late afternoon.",4.5,3.0,4.666666666666667,3.1666666666666665,3.0,2.1666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,4.0,5.0,3.5,5.333333333333333,4.0,5.0,3.5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.5,7,2.5,3.0,3.333333333333333,1,44,1,English,3,3,R_2bZBwne0dDBiH9b,0.0031171944,-0.03394589,0.17251006,0.038496125,-0.011175864,0.1779754,-0.048935883,-0.059383858,0.035922542,0.029161962,-0.06811131,0.029672299,0.17624107,0.27298543,0.059654437,0.04572574,0.04794422,-0.021330632,-0.045722924,-0.04391338,-0.011110998,0.051085886,0.0039620465,0.114367776,-0.005153345,0.06241013,0.042611428,0.025323763,-0.07544492,0.02316757,0.110366896,0.093459055,0.08360481,0.090488635,0.09673434,-0.06848089,-0.07054801,0.03512988,-0.03592229,-0.037935182,-0.059259236,0.15422498,0.101369195,0.060668074,-0.011263266,-0.0465289,-0.05552167,0.032432802,-0.0488571,0.035073504,0.06809139,0.03378883,-0.007157022,0.15192929,0.06698697,0.15302423,0.012057917,0.018455867,0.19081187,0.08381112,0.08441852,0.06869254,0.047871824,0.039828707,0.04879162,0.018311601,0.07090975,0.055521343,-0.0397215,0.057952337,0.03901939,-0.0347995,-0.032904036,0.036233712,0.07256796,-0.07970917,-0.01818236,-0.10024305,0.021275159,0.054489437,-0.14259489,-0.15199384,-0.072737604,-0.08098254,-0.12581815,-0.12265186,-0.08050431,0.038362768,-0.00026954338,0.011488387,-0.13688776,-0.09444514,-0.029988665,-0.05407715,-0.10517989,-0.015717806,-0.0046050055,-0.088836655
"My most important and central values are freedom, gratuity, and integrity. I want to be a dignified person with defined values who can set boundaries firmly and calmly without backing down. I want to be self disciplined and grateful for each experience that comes my way whether it is good or bad and realize that these are the experiences that build my character and who I am as a person. There are times where I feel broken down and like I can’t get up, but I know that the negative emotions will eventually pass and happy times will soon come again. These values were instilled in me by my parents who are now deceased so they are an integral part of my life and I try to incorporate them into as many decisions as possible.","In the past seven days I have gone to work every day. I’ve seen my coworkers and friends multiple times throughout the week. I had time to go to the grocery store yesterday so I cooked dinner with my significant other and relaxed at home for the night. Today I woke up and attended a biweekly doctors appointment, had some breakfast, then got myself ready for work and clocked back in for the day. I had a particularly bad day earlier this week in which an older man fell at my workplace but I found out today that he is okay.",4.5,4.166666666666667,5.0,2.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,4.333333333333333,6.0,3.5,5.333333333333333,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.5,5.0,6.0,5,3.1666666666666665,2.5,4.5,1,21,6,English,1,3,R_aV7P3mKCYNlrvaN,0.053147778,0.007021065,0.05396279,0.036233746,0.097474635,0.10373889,0.01114065,0.10604416,0.08423823,0.022726897,0.027014043,-0.022847544,0.16766667,0.17532477,0.14893514,0.10079065,0.06449017,0.046384193,-0.067215174,-0.030563265,0.044168744,0.024510108,0.015250698,0.013893397,0.009031253,-0.014299996,0.11015444,0.015448421,-0.06024706,0.009071983,0.078173794,0.07577447,-0.02013403,0.03561672,-0.03219274,0.06458435,0.055169113,0.031567574,-0.020470615,0.061097454,0.039592683,0.11709782,0.05057929,-0.02654881,0.08966955,-0.010257412,0.06499223,-0.05047342,-0.0012464914,0.044989135,0.064854726,0.080045894,0.0791919,0.01093578,0.14684336,0.23066644,0.046255127,0.07900964,0.21279019,0.030121965,0.065928295,0.045752507,0.10888919,0.02216851,0.09290789,0.18967314,0.13016754,0.12584677,-0.026845198,0.06235514,-0.027171565,-0.04075965,0.023517895,0.07057737,0.09760829,-0.087845504,0.067626424,0.008757934,0.109313905,0.22519962,-0.15225007,-0.0084246285,-0.06217946,-0.02983731,-0.065010056,-0.012463161,-0.08954664,0.056578405,-0.04534948,0.13289829,-0.116246596,-0.007611408,-0.072342455,-0.08143008,-0.030378727,0.11778641,-0.025774362,-0.017023668
"The most important values that guide my life are honestly and trust. Every aspect of your life goes around these values. From day one you began to trust your parents. When you are at school you learn to trust your teachers. And so on. When you have a job you have both trust and honestly. You honestly report back to your boss. You trust you boss, and company you work for. Along with a personal romantic relationship. A lot of relationships are built on trust and honestly. This is something that can be broken and ruin a relationship. Trust and honestly is something that I value and take very seriously in all aspects of my life. I have a really hard time letting things go, so I think that is why I value them so much. When people don't align with your belief often times you will have a falling out, brake up, leave a job, or struggle for a while deciding what to do, and it comes back to your core values.","On Sunday of this past week by boyfriend and I woke up at about 8am at his parents house that live out of town. His dad made us fried eggs, bacon, and pancakes for breakfast. We watched football all day until about 8pm and then we started our drive back home that took 3 hours. When we got home we threw out bed sheets in the washing machine because out cat threw up and peed on them. This made a rough start for the next day. After getting about 5 hours of sleep I woke up tired, made coffee and then went to work. I started my work day with a clinical meeting and then broke by fast at noon. I supervised my therapist and hung out with my kiddos at work and then went home about 5pm. When I got home I cooked dinner and then went to the gym. About 10pm I went to bed. I did the exact same thing Monday-Thursday. Thursday night was different. My boyfriend and I went to his cousins house to watch some football. We stayed late because the game went to overtime. But we didn't mind staying late because we both took today off (Friday). Today we woke up at 9am and I made us some biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs. At noon I went and got Pho with a girlfriend and we got to catch up about work stuff (we use to work together). After I got home my friend came over with her daughter and we hung out for a while. I took her daughter last week to get her a Christmas gift so they opened both of them. After they left my boyfriend wanted me to open an early Christmas gift. He got me some lego flowers that way my flowers never die. It was so thoughtful and sweet. Now I am laying in bed while I write this while my cat lays with me.",4.166666666666667,3.1666666666666665,5.0,4.5,4.5,2.333333333333333,3.5,3.6666666666666665,4.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,6.0,6.0,3.5,6.0,6,2.833333333333333,3.0,2.6666666666666665,1,24,1,english,1,6,R_33dlf3vQeUWCaC4,-0.058481596,-0.091103286,0.08396618,0.0050389282,-0.035764508,0.034089904,-0.025364894,0.015428014,0.017484352,0.046340488,-0.112511426,-0.08773188,-0.07050475,0.016486138,0.031205665,0.011229884,-0.03291271,0.09099085,-0.004006412,0.0029903762,0.007141106,0.023084337,-0.01257414,0.009462447,-0.004899971,0.03831035,0.07678228,0.07092529,-0.04415394,-0.013310306,0.07303019,0.17587888,0.0849522,-0.022506721,0.029225463,-0.11854365,-0.034983024,-0.008957794,-0.11461631,-0.046809882,-0.1625965,0.121344894,0.054627135,-0.12919727,-0.063564464,-0.121242926,-0.10483211,-0.07076017,-0.10765621,-0.014141627,-0.10608036,-0.071937576,-0.001647152,-0.022834629,0.036009185,0.079263255,-0.11182733,-0.050674878,0.15406197,0.011111893,-0.043747924,0.016256528,-0.07438309,-0.084560946,-0.023126263,0.0036934763,0.082437605,0.003933777,0.0033023208,-0.007452294,-0.014766373,-0.09439124,0.043337245,-0.019916374,0.0061950516,-0.051554512,-0.020372586,-0.10542482,0.008195635,0.1173751,-0.103515014,-0.118338555,-0.07197371,-0.043233022,-0.03619252,0.007650718,-0.1416989,-0.008217827,-0.011888389,-0.03409289,-0.11802557,-0.090403736,-0.09385215,-0.09129796,-0.027281988,-0.0241763,-0.059368093,-0.13736957
I try to follow the laws of God. Jesus is so important to me and He died for all of our sins. I try to follow His teachings. I try to honor Him in all of my actions. I try to treat people as I would want to be treated. I try to pray and ask Jesus to help me throughout my life and He is always there for me. He gives me strength to keep on going. He helps me find joy and beauty in a world that can be cold at times. Without Him I am lost. I want to be with Him forever at the end of this life on Earth.,"I started the week by going to church on Sunday morning. After this we stopped at the store to pick up a few groceries. I watched my two granddaughters on Monday. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I did some driving for Uber Eats. I am disabled so I can only do a few deliveries before I am worn out. This brings in extra income that I so desperately need. Friday I again watched my granddaughters for half of the day. I then took a nap, played with my cat. In between this I cleaned up the house, cooked a few dinners, said my prayers. I wanted to do some painting but I just ran out of steam.",4.166666666666667,1.1666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,4.5,3.8333333333333335,4.0,3.8333333333333335,3.1666666666666665,6.0,2.5,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.5,2.5,5.0,25,2.833333333333333,6.0,3.5,1,62,1,English,1,3,R_5mAXEyWCoCQwyyJ,0.04049401,0.052158788,0.15730076,0.12405115,0.071802035,0.27947104,0.079998754,0.11466032,0.1584616,0.13400055,0.011228703,0.13410152,0.26652217,0.33112055,0.21669637,0.14020137,0.13692637,0.12850565,0.014801307,-0.020312836,0.1243572,0.14411525,0.048923634,0.06873023,-0.01778587,0.07057633,0.22253871,0.1364478,-0.019095909,0.023756912,0.2098875,0.18469793,0.1433275,0.18014005,0.08914445,0.002406519,0.059782833,0.060107023,-0.044783685,-0.0045447145,0.0070313886,0.27836573,0.12018104,0.14125289,0.13987608,0.005882304,0.080718055,0.011729824,0.16838619,0.18856217,0.05287631,0.07873793,0.21090329,0.23870994,0.18974334,0.2552237,0.14904444,0.18108895,0.29247412,0.19896255,0.24621958,0.11293283,0.06507897,0.06268791,0.038829744,0.16357782,0.1201117,0.11967614,0.06857966,0.053795364,0.12073737,0.049944226,0.10674714,0.07775442,0.10910244,0.06279142,0.086155646,0.07853524,0.06396277,0.14043997,-0.033175603,-0.0090050865,0.011080831,-0.039934203,-0.062022395,-0.10967976,-0.06434402,0.1235152,0.10797344,0.1419734,0.02205604,-0.0746036,-0.03334348,-0.01526718,-0.047665782,0.031094339,-0.04978995,-0.0018719882
"The most important thing to me is helping others.  The main way I do that is through my work.  I work as part of a commissions team, and part of my role is to make sure that the payments we make are accurate.  I spend many hours each day reviewing the data from many standpoints to ensure our payments will be as accurate as possible.  I make sure that the right amount is paid on the right deals in the right month to the right people.  It is a matter of pride to me and to my team, and a matter of trust between us and the people we pay.  I monitor our systems proactively to prevent issues from happening.

Another way that I help people is through one-on-one training.  Since our team works remotely, I tend to interact with my co-workers through video calls and screen shares.  Sometimes I share my screen, but more often I let them share their screen.  This way I can watch as they walk me through the process they are asking me about.  I can see what parts they understand and where they could use some help, then I teach them how to work through their issue - whether it's how to create a report or view to monitor their activity, or where to look to find the information they are missing.  By educating and empowering my co-workers, I am helping them to become more productive, and helping them to succeed, which gives me a sense of pride and purpose.","Last Saturday, my youngest son and I went Christmas shopping together.  I drove, and we went to a large mall about 40 minutes away.  We stopped at several stores while looking for a particular store which had apparently gone out of business, since we never did find it.  We got hungry so we went to the food court and picked up some food at Taco Bell.  The food court is right under the movie theaters, which put us in the mood to see a movie.  We headed upstairs and found out that the movie we wanted to see would start in about an hour. 
 That gave us time to take our purchases out to the car, then come back and get our tickets plus some munchies.  After the movie we stopped at one more store then headed home.   On Sunday, my oldest son and I went Christmas shopping. He drove, and we went to his favorite hobby shop, about an hour away.  Next we got lunch at Taco Bell (a family favorite), then went to a book store, then came home.   We sat by the wood stove and watched Netflix until supper, then he headed back to his house.  Monday through Friday I worked from my home office during the day and watched Netflix in the evenings.  On Wednesday, my oldest son's girlfriend stopped by to visit and we sat by the wood stove and talked between work and Netflix.

"Having love for someone is a very important value to me. I love my family, friends, and my pets. Showing that love is important as well, so that the ones I truly care about can see that I love and care for them as well. Respect is another important value to me. If someone doesn't show me respect when I am giving it to them, it shows that I don't need this person in my life. It means that they don't care about me, so I shouldn't waste my time on them.","I have went to the store to get a few groceries. I have went to a job interview. I have washed dishes, clean my bathroom, done laundry, and cleaned my living room. I have baked a cake for my culinary school assignment. I have cooked a few meals for lunch and dinner.

"Important values that guide my life, are god first in everything. Without him we would not even be here on this earth. Doing good deeds and treating others with respect. It's not good to get even with people when they do you wrong. You always have to think about the good in everything. Being respectful to your elderly people and always saying thank you and please. Going out of your way once and a while helping out a stranger that you don't know. You never know what something as simple as paying for someones meal, or opening a door, or giving them a compliment can do to someone. It could make their entire day. Having your heart in the good is always a plus.","Over the passed 7 days I have been christmas shopping online and in store, wrapping presents that I have already gotten. I have attended therapy sessions with my son that has nonverbal autism. I have did paperwork for the therapies. I have cooked meals, and looked up new recipes. I attended a birthday party for a friends kid at a local skating rink. I have watched some movies and tv shows on tv. I have looked up the news to see everything going on. I have taken many pictures as well over the past 7 days. I have also made some holiday treats to snack on. We also made a gingerbread house even though it got destroyed not long after by my son. It was ok though, it's all about the memories being made.

"One of my guiding values is simplicity. This simplicity extends from modest consumption to fewer but closer relationships. Simplicity as a guiding value can provide a lower stress, less competitive existence. This may sound simple in itself, but arguably difficult in the context of a consumer driven society, where more is better. Simplicity can be a good approach to lower consumption driven climate change; unfortunately, society promotes consumption and comparison.","Most of the past week is a routine of managing a child in my home. This includes meals, transportation to and from school, and leisure activities. Of course, each day starts with morning activities to get ready for the day, and after having something to eat, heading out into the world. Most weekday routines are similar, returning to prepare dinner, eat, dishes, followed by evening routines of television, bathing, brushing, etc. Weekends often include laundry, errands such as grocery, and other leisure activities.",2.333333333333333,1.5,2.6666666666666665,2.1666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,1.8333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.333333333333333,3.0,4.5,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.0,8,2.833333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665,2,50,6,English,8,5,R_2qfJxr11PHB2GgQ,0.039196715,0.14423704,0.1343105,0.09410678,0.0052671,0.15450156,0.08921011,0.060160615,0.07853994,0.08607179,-0.048991106,0.1916178,0.2978112,0.41754454,0.062086754,0.08576582,0.05158437,0.10442021,0.055411704,0.04907877,0.12225283,0.090758145,-0.009479003,0.16753228,0.1847499,0.17379794,0.2053554,0.16051008,0.025527004,0.098081596,0.19073823,0.09940857,0.03750417,0.18406987,0.17853928,0.074870065,0.19482562,0.17384231,0.069895476,0.0009976942,0.14378819,0.17378685,0.115791,0.14931215,0.09932017,0.09115539,0.02459428,0.05608813,0.09168149,0.19687153,0.089282475,0.11049433,0.13003014,0.3056294,0.10559613,0.26438624,0.043465108,0.175338,0.2986326,0.1753466,0.17288373,0.1000632,0.08237424,0.0035079494,-0.004782811,-0.013148129,0.0057710204,-0.035474885,0.01034393,0.040767923,0.1181428,0.03213283,0.069651484,-0.09330309,0.023354549,-0.0063425377,0.046691872,-0.062512614,0.091610834,0.07879181,0.032774508,-0.14914781,0.0026839692,-0.04683319,-0.06263694,-0.040364236,0.11291694,0.3117585,0.12839414,0.11093442,0.09415975,0.035225883,0.006638117,0.053795688,-0.11157932,0.0055962205,-0.02394329,0.022748588
"My main value in life is to experience as much as I possibly can. I believe each person is put on this earth to see and do and explore as much as they possibly can. I constantly try to integrate new experiences in my life and constantly switch up my routine. I believe sitting stagnantly is the number one way to waste your life. I am always trying to make new friends and go new places. I believe somewhere along the way as you are growing, changing, and evolving you find your true purpose in life. Without new experiences and meeting new people we never truly grow. New places and people inspire and teach us things that we could never learn otherwise.",Last weekend I started Christmas shopping. I went to several different stores and made several orders online. On Monday I went to work and did my regular shift duties such as stocking shelves and assisting customers. That night I got chic-fil-a for dinner for me and my boyfriend. On Tuesday I adopted a new kitten named Yona. On Wednesday I went to Walmart to get all the necessary supplies for my new kitten. Then I came home and set up her litterbox and played with her for a few hours. On Thursday I went out bowling with some friends. We ended up going out for drinks afterwards. Today I laid in bed and watched some of my favorite horror movies while cuddling with my new kitten and my dog Lucy. Then I decided to get on Mturk and work for a few hours.,5.0,4.666666666666667,3.5,2.333333333333333,1.5,2.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,5.5,4.5,6.0,5.0,4.5,6.0,4.0,3.5,5.5,6.0,9,2.833333333333333,1.0,3.8333333333333335,1,23,6,English,1,3,R_9LZIniSW4rTsvbr,-0.024037646,-0.0684756,0.14914387,0.10517746,0.049594328,0.1379314,-0.008115079,0.045943256,0.0702176,0.03729651,-0.061139096,-0.00594851,0.10187374,0.1012065,0.103460506,0.046857826,0.014740068,0.06261882,0.01702627,0.028193936,0.012941143,0.01570611,0.02394017,0.050648127,-0.014904205,0.007013175,0.16244592,0.007771421,-0.04860702,-0.090110816,0.098354995,0.15990731,0.059854433,0.105175085,-0.032740377,-0.09356303,-0.016364357,-0.0080991015,-0.10436437,-0.055726428,-0.116191484,0.19312319,0.10293308,0.024184084,0.05448356,-0.10326558,0.025626246,-0.040398456,0.034328267,0.078978494,-0.0032563359,0.0121831335,0.26818597,0.17098598,0.13127524,0.12999953,0.06416724,0.10107987,0.25495192,0.1684992,0.11698098,0.09019637,-0.06307657,-0.046329707,-0.016444888,0.06405635,0.039379325,0.08566238,-0.024516629,-0.058428828,-0.0068486948,-0.06752274,-0.0064836238,0.060182154,-0.004549261,-0.08878922,-0.02925573,0.04498195,-0.035709567,0.19320208,-0.13118036,-0.021280024,-0.04210765,-0.08176166,-0.04204716,-0.08958645,-0.106110394,0.026121961,-0.07793769,0.0019012126,-0.11592072,-0.13185248,-0.079028666,-0.048816632,-0.019038305,0.13727196,-0.061883826,-0.030194633
my biggest value is Honesty and speaking the truth and never trying not to lie. I hate when people say different things depending who they are with. for me it is important to say the truth and never say a lie. another value that I have is my family. they mean everything to me. they are the one who I can turn to for all my problems. they have helped me through out my life. I am who I am because of them. My other value is loyalty. I can never think about betraying someone who put their trust in me. I always try to think how I will feel if who I trust is not trustworthy.,My week is very basic and same. I will  write about Monday and all the other days are pretty much the same except Saturday and Sunday. We start Monday with my husband going to work.

"This one doesn't sound as easy as the seven days but I'll give it a try. My guiding principals consist of whatever I feel is best for my family. My family is what guides my decisions, along with what is right from wrong. I try to instill values that teach my children to not judge others based on race, religion, sexuality, size and so on, and I do my best to lead by example.","Let's see, what have I done in the past seven days? Well last Friday I spent the day at home cleaning and doing laundry then in the late afternoon I took two of my teenage sons and mother-in-law Christmas shopping. It was a fun evening and we weren't out to late. Saturday was a day at home, decorating the house and Christmas tree. Sunday, again, a day at home. We finished the lights on the house, final decorations on the tree and my husband left for Illinois. Monday was a day of schoolwork, teaching a history class for our local home school cooperative. After teaching, my two sons and myself met my oldest son for dinner at a local Mexican restaurant, then off to Walmart for them to find White Elephant gifts for a Drama class party the next day. Next day is here, Tuesday. Woke up early to bake cookies and wrap gifts for their teachers and for their white elephant gift exchange. Drama is a little over an hour drive so we, two boys, mother-in-law and myself,  left early, stopped for fuel and a quick lunch before dropping them off for three hours of fun. Spent the next two and half hours helping my mother-in-law get all of her Christmas shopping complete. After our final store we headed back to pick the boys up from their party and our hour drive home. The hour drive turned in to more like one and three quarters an hour due to an accident on the freeway. After getting home, changing clothes, wrapping one last gift and gathering the supplies we were back out the door for their Teen Night Christmas party, local home school group, I had organized at a community center in a town near us. Two and half hours of fun, visiting and another gift exchange then it was home, sandwiches for dinner and pajamas. Finally ten o'clock, devices off, everyone to your rooms and asleep by eleven. Yay! Tuesday is over and Wednesday was just grocery shopping and dinner at home.",3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.1666666666666665,3.0,2.333333333333333,1.8333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.1666666666666665,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,16,2.833333333333333,3.5,3.333333333333333,1,48,1,english,15,4,R_ripf2Q9jl5dzWnv,0.012717437,0.04487115,0.105911866,0.012165494,0.07350357,0.19865571,0.04475961,0.15261513,0.15604141,0.104738355,-0.016200991,0.08031799,0.10971695,0.16616595,0.030020287,0.052431718,0.089417145,0.06441073,-0.020387813,-0.00019410811,0.040702112,0.04856594,0.05788986,0.095723875,0.04214659,0.12587807,0.09380492,0.15217872,-0.00952821,0.036319263,0.1463536,0.20023747,0.10326053,0.0832285,0.035492413,0.00077080773,0.08557005,0.074619725,-0.039037395,0.061641656,-0.02260801,0.196583,0.058411743,-0.012971717,0.10518125,-0.029070295,-0.016936272,-0.024016932,0.05098483,0.07002079,-0.04312924,-0.036940668,0.16218823,0.11343201,0.16781375,0.15601498,0.077926576,0.15330142,0.28390628,0.05616682,0.09121901,0.08713414,-0.019379321,-0.03083293,0.02813724,0.0649409,0.081697315,0.10554311,0.048126068,0.049884483,0.094118044,0.015652139,0.11839537,0.035146516,0.03081749,0.058499295,-0.009401185,0.028273536,0.037258998,0.08226649,0.052963503,-0.022142733,0.024628026,-0.018568326,0.021681968,-0.03653904,0.01526754,0.23633987,0.15830728,0.108151115,0.13716148,-0.006377043,-0.014155533,0.008534279,-0.049019217,0.020865317,-0.07240872,-0.032329585
My family means more to me than anything.  I would do almost anything for them.  I will go without things in order to provide things for my sons.  I have a hard time spending money on things that I want when I know that there are things that my sons need.  I make sure that they make good grades and that they have food to eat at home.  I like being a care giver.  I like teaching and guiding.  I love to see my sons learn new things.,"I started getting ready for Christmas.  My house needed to be decorated and the gifts needed to be wrapped.  On the first day, I got my Christmas tree out of storage.  I put it up and decorated it.  This took me several hours to complete the task.  The next day I gathered up all of the Christmas gifts that I had bought over the past few days.  I separated them into piles according to who they were going to.  I spent about an hour each night for 3 nights wrapping these gifts and putting them under the trees.  And last but not least, I planned out my Christmas day dinner menu.",5.0,2.833333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.166666666666667,3.0,3.5,4.0,5.5,5.0,6.0,5.5,5.5,6.0,5.0,5.5,5.5,5.0,16,3.333333333333333,4.5,3.5,1,49,1,english,1,4,R_3Ra0wteL0CIxcMg,0.046732638,0.12657341,0.17394635,0.17569251,0.14054585,0.1334641,0.15420672,0.17721447,0.16088775,0.08270046,0.056117713,0.13642839,0.20246993,0.2275496,0.070562646,0.12881145,0.17248611,-0.017396316,-0.054296583,-0.011590607,0.06850219,-0.01519252,0.04924443,0.087269895,0.036049187,0.15391082,0.13233626,0.030237539,-0.02017564,0.034778144,0.23543271,0.12991956,0.111022264,0.19486272,0.051050525,-0.06246522,0.06808674,-0.00380956,-0.087556235,-0.04371324,-0.034706473,0.23877291,0.17263956,0.11839694,0.17008904,0.014989851,0.077827096,0.008433387,0.11614691,0.14290345,0.048603784,0.050266568,0.2681243,0.13021025,0.16644177,0.19918707,0.18913166,0.25281495,0.3055815,0.19232383,0.1769971,0.16271581,-0.0017796457,-0.035482213,0.01144461,0.08050838,0.07641554,0.10508217,0.056956127,-0.00042365678,0.15631422,0.0622089,0.14493862,0.07523249,0.056380145,0.08338095,0.054079525,0.09619698,0.010574322,0.11641076,-0.06167642,0.0054418426,-0.007505418,-0.02787368,0.05849982,-0.02336377,0.07824214,0.2728957,0.078110084,0.11784497,0.022503758,0.014322454,-0.00701952,0.07615962,-0.042070016,0.08449219,-0.057655413,0.06540403
"My family is the most important thing in my life. My husband and I have a grown Autistic son. It is my goal to make sure he is happy and well cared for. We own a 300 acre farm. The farm animals and our cats and dogs are good therapy. We raise a huge garden that we all work in. It makes us appreciate good food. Vegtables taste so much better right out of the garden.Just loving each other and making sure we all are happy and well cared for is the most important thing in the world to me. We live a simple life, but it is so fulfilling.","My family get up every day at 6 a.m. We begin our day with a nice breakfast, and coffee. After we eat we go out and feed our 100 head of cattle. We check them over and count them. If a cow is hollering there is usually something wrong. After that we go home for a break, then we do the household chores. After lunch we go back out and work. In the winter we work on equipment, clean up barns. Straighten up the work room. Around 4 we go back in get a bath, and fix supper. On top of all of this we have been getting ready for Christmas. we got our tree up, Made some fudge, and some other good candy that we will hand out to our neighbors on Christmas Eve.",5.0,3.0,3.8333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.5,4.333333333333333,4.0,3.5,3.5,5.666666666666668,4.0,5.0,1.5,5.5,6.0,2.0,3.5,24,2.333333333333333,6.0,3.6666666666666665,1,59,1,English,1,4,R_2y9HZS4XUuEzJaV,0.022318814,0.14667347,0.08769967,0.11188878,0.08936452,0.2409542,0.05915325,0.1553477,0.16885146,0.19748956,0.046439264,0.15589158,0.21436332,0.23744693,0.07357279,0.12564568,0.13830163,0.021640196,-0.031138513,0.058443632,0.13088098,0.11083111,0.094869554,0.13658193,0.11605668,0.17261547,0.15416881,0.20130743,0.049389407,-0.013596651,0.20997831,0.1456448,0.0941259,0.23474899,0.048032913,0.1009691,0.14360318,0.12756565,0.024376675,0.024004847,0.09492031,0.21905842,0.051286295,0.12406558,0.13837546,0.06974381,0.079585366,0.11834474,0.09995564,0.15520819,0.09197508,0.082864,0.2344992,0.17434771,0.1821123,0.23335527,0.16935241,0.2626298,0.30523092,0.14299582,0.2202802,0.06877593,0.06562377,0.079828694,0.08855795,0.082178146,0.14413497,0.14919457,0.07506426,0.14254534,0.1684551,0.088767685,0.15926191,0.18318684,0.14311917,0.13146704,0.1339326,0.122529,0.117508665,0.11694434,-0.009116221,0.047275305,0.097883515,0.061055064,0.023314267,0.00015587732,0.1644442,0.31705642,0.09990905,0.17126667,0.08666238,0.028658487,0.04983753,0.047073193,0.011840876,0.032455392,0.012307551,0.021567393
"My first guiding value/behavior is kindness.  I treat people with kindness and respect.  Everyone deserves my best efforts, it's not only the right thing to do for others but for me as well.  I also value the generosity of spirit. I feel we are here to help one another, it's a primary purpose for humans.  We need to care for each other, all people we meet.  I believe we are spirits, we have a human body but we're spirits and I don't find it difficult to ""lead"" with my spirit.  I enjoy interacting with others very much.  I learn a lot about myself as much as of the other person.  Over-riding all my behaviors is being genuine.  Being authentic is the most important thing in all I do.","Over the last week, I had a bit of a cold, I spent some of last weekend sleeping and napping.  I tried to stay away from others as I didn't want to pass along my cold.  The first few weekdays I worked from home, on a reduced schedule as I was up to date on my work.  There were emails and texts to deal with but it was a light load.  On Wednesday I was in need of some grocery store supplies so I went to replenish some items.  I was feeling much better so I  made plans to go out to breakfast with my sister to a spot we both enjoy and a friend is a waitress.  Then we did a bit of Christmas shopping.

"The most important values in my life are integrity, kindness, and gratitude. 
Having integrity is staying true to yourself and doing the right thing when no one is watching. I think it’s important for people to always act right. Kindness is treating others the way you want to be treated. If everyone did that the world would be a better place. Gratitude is being thankful for life and the things you have. I think it’s important to find positivity during tough times.
","The last 7 days have been similar. My husband and I have a baby. He goes to work, while I watch the baby. I do activities to keep the baby entertained. After work we go to the gym and workout.

"The most important values in my life are related to my faith.  1 have a few things that I try to live by.  To Whom much is given much is required.  I believe that I have been blessed and I feel that I should use talent and give when I have the opportunity.  I believe that you should work hard in life because you work to honor God, people are watching and you represent your upbringing.  How you act and what you say is representative of your family, the company you work for or your household.  Another value that I live by is to be a good steward.  Don't spend tomorrow's prosperity.   I learned this early on by going through bad circumstances and fortunately, one time.  I made a point of learning about preparation, saving and investing, as well as trying to advantage of opportunities that come along or learning different things.","Over the past 7 days, I have done a lot of things.  I have worked 5 days a week.  I have gone grocery shopping 3x.  I have gone to a doctor's appointment.  I have gotten a vaccine shot at a pharmacy.  I have watched several Christmas movies.  I have gone online to comparison shop several options of streaming.  I was finalized a selection and reached out to customer service because of an issue that was resolved.  I walked outside to get my steps up.  I went to church virtually.  I participated in 2 different bible study classes.  I prepared a slow cooker dish.  I participated in a virtual meeting for 3 days at work.  I researched recipes for the holidays, like carrot cake.  I participated in a morning devotional group.  I watched a few football games.

"I am here to serve and, on occasion, when I have the opportunity, to pursue my own interests.  The most important thing for me is for me to do what I can to support my wife and children.  There is something to be said for God, Country, and Family, in that order, and that's always in the back of my head.  I wish it was actually more in the for front of my thoughts instead!  I guess I try to treat others like I like to be treated, but I have no expectation on others about that.  It makes me happy when I can help others be happy, but, more often than not, I am engrossed in my work of the day.  Regardless, I still try to live up to those ideals.  Here's another basic guiding principle for me:  Ideally, I am 1/3 student, 1/3 teach, and 1/3 doer - and sometimes these fractions differ depending on the situation, but I strive for balance.","Food and drink shop for the upcoming holidays.

"AFter losing my husband to an abrupt and sudden death, everything about life looks different, I've come to realize that all the things I used to consider important, like career, success, money, traveling are all secondary to family, friends, love, time spent together. Those things aren't bad, but I realize that spending a day with my grandaughter, talking about her tween drama over lunch, laying on the couch talking about life in general, is so much more fulfilling than spending a day at work creating the next best marketing strategy. Talking on the phone with my grandson about his wife being pregnant and how his life just went from being a college kid waiting tables to graduating from college, taking a job at a school this semester and a baby on the way. He just hit serious adulthood, discussing it at length with him is so much more fulfilling than creating e-mail campaigns for the company I work for. If I could go back in time, my career would ALWAYS come second my family would ALWAYS come first. My friends, my family, the relationships, in the end, they are all that matters. My volunteer work is a critical part of my identity as well, but again, if I had to rearrange things in my life in order of importance, Family, FRiends, Volunteer work, career.","Two friends and I went to a movie in Springfield, about 30 minutes from our hometown. After the movie, we went to eat at Applebee's and then drove home later that night. The following morning I went to Church, after Church I came home and started decorating my house with Christmas decorations. Before coming home after church though I stopped at a deli and picked up enough food that I didn't have to cook for myself all day or run back into town to get something to eat. The next day which was Monday, I went to work but left early because I felt kind of sick. On my way home, I stopped by Wal-Mart to buy some Christmas tree lights and some storage bins so I could organize things in my extra bedroom which has become a catch-all and looks kind of like something you'd see on hoarders. By the time I got home, (which is 45 minutes from where I work) I was feeling full-fledged sick and went straight to bed without eating anything, By Tuesday morning I knew I had something pretty nasty so I called in sick to work and spent the rest of the day on the couch sneezing and coughing. Nothing tasted good, I kept trying to find anything satisfying but absolutely nothing...except for Noosa Vanilla Bean Yogurt tasted good. Wednesday my son brought some food over so I didn't have to go to the store and I spent Wednesday and Thursday in bed. I missed the Christmas party at CHurch Thursday night with all the girls from our ladies' Bible Study. Friday my grandson was graduating from the University of Missouri so I forced myself to get ready and go to the graduation. After graduation, the whole family went to Longhorn Steakhouse and I had a Prime Rib that was amazing. I drove home in a downpour and nearly ran off the road twice because of poor visibility. I made it home safely and went back to bed.",5.0,1.6666666666666667,3.333333333333333,3.5,3.1666666666666665,2.0,3.5,4.0,6.0,3.5,5.333333333333333,4.5,5.5,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,6.0,23,3.1666666666666665,5.0,4.166666666666667,1,62,1,English,1,4,R_2wmGBzYbN5mz85L,-0.04660716,-0.050422344,0.0541057,-0.01377058,0.024542525,0.14464343,-0.052118868,0.051087372,0.055898912,0.10739769,-0.06006567,-0.033782706,0.080155134,0.12112057,0.15498486,0.074443564,0.055512942,0.08291784,-0.047463574,-0.057767738,0.038582653,0.024044871,0.028564177,0.007296513,-0.0129551515,-0.0067331977,0.08990043,0.015557159,-0.065629676,-0.038654763,0.07189408,0.16679034,0.08961891,0.037886687,0.010161083,0.0024067555,0.030441344,0.038778707,-0.086681545,0.024519416,-0.05703567,0.17611265,0.037623793,-0.009094492,-0.016953852,-0.11469838,-0.039472103,-0.027051222,-0.03919364,0.014187473,0.015426543,0.0068944003,0.1902535,0.07563722,0.086780876,0.12548205,0.035519037,0.06780571,0.21755527,0.04611441,0.054364182,-0.030635003,0.04298622,0.01855532,0.014047474,0.08480863,0.08235773,0.1124949,0.0145920925,0.035256974,0.00852773,0.0009086076,0.014611008,0.030595597,-0.0012628594,-0.03919534,-0.015584534,-0.018947748,0.0035716146,0.15396062,-0.21919748,-0.077757016,-0.042322002,-0.11487621,-0.10869433,-0.102017835,-0.054185662,0.08756575,-0.030574488,0.010555062,-0.156606,-0.08724822,0.020162322,-0.00026420504,-0.014145882,0.11652213,0.03136312,-0.09304786
