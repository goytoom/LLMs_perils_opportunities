"My most important value is gotta be money, which guided me through each day's sex films.  On off-days, I get to utilize my money to buy all types of luxury items that I wanted, from jewelry to exotic clothing.  I could get certain handsome men to bed when I wanted as I am usually their idol.  With money, my pleasure can be served at highest, even better than the orgasm that I enjoyed while having my legs dangle in the air as I was being penetrated by these men.  Money is always power and safety as in value for me.","The past 7 days have been the same for me daily, as I wake up I get dressed in lingerie corset and high heels.

I think the most central and important values in my life are working hard and being consistent. I think that in my values I work hard to take care of my daughter and am committed to my family. These values have always been important to me. From a young age I learned that working hard is something that allows me to get ahead and achieve the goals I set out for myself. I think being consistent is the only way you make lifelong progress.  I use these to make difficult decisions because they give me the confidence to know I can make either decision and still come out ahead. I use these with my family to take care of them.,"In the past seven days I have gotten up and gotten my daughter ready for the day. I change her and get her dressed. We then eat breakfast together. Then I allow her to play on her own while I work. Some days I go to work so I drop her off at my moms. When I don't work we usually have an outing in the morning, we go shopping or to the park. Then we come home, eat lunch, and she watches her show while I work online. Then I put her down for her nap and work online some more. THen I get her up. If i'm working that day I pick her up. Then we play outside for a bit, then come inside and make dinner. We generally eat then take a bath. Then I read to her and she goes to sleep. Then I work online then hang out with my husband.

"Avoid a black and white world view. Understand that life is shades of grey, and everyone has a reason for their actions. If someone or something tries to explain a person or event in completely black and white terms and tells you ""That's the entire story!"", be suspicious.

Strive for positivity. In today's world it's extremely easy to get mired in negativity and snark. It's not healthy; find the good in life and focus on that, bring up a smile, and try to spread that positivity around. Negativity has never helped anyone.

Honor your commitments, and be honest in all dealings. Pretty straightforward.

Stay curious. Don't simply accept things at face value; not sure what's going on with an event? Research it! See something interesting? Look into it! One of the great joys of living in this time period is access to information and knowledge.

Treat others as you'd like to be treated. This one is basically straight out of the Bible, and really doesn't need much explanation. Treat others with kindness whenever possible.

Realize that you don't have the answers, but strive for knowledge.

"I think the main values that guide me in my life all comes down to this old saying. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I try to live by this motto in nearly all my daily interactions with the people I come into contact with. If I'm driving down the road I wave at other drivers. If I'm at the grocery store or gas station I smile and am polite to the cashiers. Even at home, I try to keep the music and television at a normal volume level so as to not disturb my neighbors. I try to not gossip about other people. These are all things that I like when other people treat me this way, so I make an effort at all times to treat other people the same way.","Ok so a week ago then I suppose would have been last Friday. On Fridays I usually get up and have breakfast, check my emails, shower and get my clothes on for work. I head into work and do my daily tasks there.

So I get to get out of the office on a regular basis. The weekends I have off, I spend them mostly doing chores around the house and playing video games online with my friends. Monday through Thursday again are work days, so it's similar to the Friday I spoke of earlier. I'll talk more about the weekends.

"I think at the center of my life is trying to enjoy the present and be my best self. I believe in the idea that I create my life, that I write the narrative. So okay, i don't always love my job but whether or not I have a good day at work rests almost entirely on how I frame my day mentallly. I try to look at the tasks I perform as enjoyable, to see the positive in them, to take note of pleasant interactions and to see unpleasant interactions as learning experiences. And my commute is long, but I try to see it as part of my day rather than as a means to get to the next part of my day, if that makes sense - try to enjoy the commute as a time to listen to an audiobook, enjoy scenery, breathe, unwind All of the things I do, It ry to see them as positives. And I also think kindness and connections to others make it easier to live like this. Realizing that I am one of many and not the only one. I work out and meditate and take care of myself with good healthy food, and still indulge in alcohol and less healthy food too - all about finding balance and bieng in the present moment.","Starting last week, which would be Saturday I guess - so Saturday I did a lot of shopping for the house, as well as clearing out the upstairs bedrooms.

He said that every other ethical principle or law can be summed up by these two. Love is the encryption key that unlocks complex problems.

"I think a central value for me is simplicity. I try very hard to not consume too much whether it is possessions, food, energy or the time and attention of either my mind or of others. I work hard to find pleasure in simple things that I have overlooked in the past: being alive, drinking a glass of water, eating food and exercise. In this way, when unusual and pleasureable things do happen: a new pair of earrings, a nice meal at a restaurant, I really enjoy them as I do not indulge in them often.

A second important value for me is pay attention to where I am and one important secondary value related to this is to be outside and be aware of the natural world. Being in nature helps me be present. 

","In the past 7 days I ran errands, specifically last weekend, including going to a home improvement store to buy caulk and to the local post office to mail a package. I also visited the local library to try and find a new Agatha Christie book to read. These activities happen weekly, usually. 
I also engaged in the usual daily tasks such as waking up, drinking coffee, making the bed, having breakfast (a bagel, quite often) and doing some work. Three times I went for a vigorous walk or an easy jog. I prepared dinner and did a winding down practice before bed each day consisting of yoga and a meditation.

"One value I try to stand by is being truthful in all aspects of my life.  That means always been truthful to others and to myself.  Even when things go poorly or I don't accomplish something I need to I try to let in people close to me and discuss these issues.  I also try to be productive every day.  I want to feel accomplished in my life, and that means I need to stay on task and accomplish goals.  I push myself to be productive even when I do not want to be because it adds value to my life.  Having rewarding experiences is another goal of mine.  This is valuable because it is what life is all about.  When combining being truthful and productive the next step is applying these to life.  Whether that is vacations, adventures, or goals these can all ultimately be rewarding.  I want to do this because when I am older I want to be able to look back on my life with pride and know that I did not waste the time I had.  All of these values are very important and I always have them in the back of my mind.","My past week has been spent doing normal activities along with some irregular tasks.

"A value is what is considered important in life, what makes life worth living. A values is also something that help us decide what is right or wrong in moral term.

There are different kinds of values such as social, personal, universal, moral, spiritual, cultural etc.

Friendship, patience, tolerance and love can be consider as social values. Honesty, creativity, imagination and excellence can be consider as personal values. Peace, human dignity, equal human rights and freedom can be consider as universal values. Respect to others and ourselves, keep promises, show gratitude to others, encourage others are moral values. Purity, piety, meditation, self-discipline, self-control, devotion to god can be consider as spiritual values. Cultural values allows us to situate ourselves in relation to the society we live in.

All these values are important in life to achieve success and live healthy, happily, trusty.

Personally I practice four values in life.

Health is the greatest gift,
Contentment is the greatest wealth,
Trust is the best relative,
Liberated mind is the greatest bliss.

I gained health & happiness by following things in life.

Anybody can accept and practice three values Respect, Friendship and Excellence under any circumstance.","Respect is different kinds. Respect for yourself, respect for others, respect for rules, respect for life, respect for the environment and many more. Basically respect for everything. respect is kind of business. If you respect somebody or something we are receiving respect. We can’t expect respect from somebody without giving respect.

"The most important values to me is kindness and good will. I think that being good to each other is the best thing that we can do. I firmly believe in considering other people's well-being first and being as good of a person that you can be. I think that being non-judgmental and assuming the best about people is also very important as a guiding principle in my life. I have had the same life principals since I was a child, really. I have always asked the ""what-ifs,"" like maybe that person is having a bad day and that's why they acted in that way.","Every morning of the past week has been the same: I get up and get my self ready for the day. I start the pot of coffee that has been prepped the day before. I start my shower. I get my makeup on and then I drink my coffee while I look at my phone, check my emails, check my social media. Each day, I woke my son up at 6:45am so that he can get ready for school. I start his day by making him breakfast, usually either cereal or pancakes. I brush his teeth after breakfast and then I get him dressed. I take him outside and put him on the bus to school. Almost always, I come inside and work on Mturk for a few hours. After that bit of work, I start doing my chores. I switch the laundry, empty the dishwasher. This week my dog went to the vet, where we found out that he has an ear infection, so I have been cleaning his ears and applying medication to them every day this week. My son comes home from school each day at 3;45, at which time I make dinner. This week I made pizza on Monday and Tuesday, I made shrimp scampi pasta on Wednesday, I made broccoli and cheese soup for Thursday.

"That Jesus does not ignore my sins but took them upon himself so that God does not ignore my sins but sees Jesus in me. I cannot be made lovely by what I do, whether that is pursue sex, money, or power. That I cannot soothe my desires by justifying my existence through the same avenues. Yet,  have found my justification and loveliness in Jesus. This relationship guides my honesty, in that I can own my failures and speak truth to those around me as Jesus covers me in his beauty, not that others find me lovely. That my sexuality can be controlled because I do not need someone to make me feel wanted or desirable, I am found desirable by Jesus even before I start my day. I do not need to pursue wealth with every fiber of my being because it can never provide the security I find in Jesus, he also redeems my efforts and grants me creativity to provide the resources I need. Thusly, we are one in the same, Jesus and I.","I have gone to work each of the last five days. Usually this involved preparing my breakfast and eating eat with the children. While eating we would discuss the days activities and expectations. We would conduct some bible reading and prepare our hearts for the day. We then would get moving out the door. On Wednesday I deviated from this task of getting to work and drove to get my covid booster shot. This was uneventful but fulfilling in my civic duties. Each of the five nights we have conducted our advent activities by either enjoying certain foods, painting hand made crafts, or singing songs. Last nights song was quite enjoyable, a song about a manger, as the children joined in with much joy. Saturday and Sunday, the two days prior to the past week, involved visiting with our Grandfather and going to church.

The things that matters the most to me is that I can truly be myself in my relationships and not be shamed all the time because it doesn't look like what another person thinks is good for me. We are not all the same. We don't all want the same things. We should be free to love what we love and not have to defend it all the time. Who cares if it doesn't look like you? I am my own person. I have my own mind and my own beliefs. I don't have to be a cut out of another person. I don't care what another person believes is acceptable. I don't care what another person believes my faith should be. The most important thing to me is my autonomy. I am sick and tired of being treated like a child and watching the world treat grown adults like children who can not decide for themselves what they want to do with their own body. Our body is ours.

After my exercising, I get back to my desk and work on the computer reading e-mail.  After a cup of coffee or two, I head to the shower and have breakfast after that.

"I try to live my life based on the principle of ""live and let live"". If someone is doing something that does not directly interfere with myself or others, I see no harm in it. This for me means that I do not put much worth in things like the ""traditional family"" or gender roles, and I believe that everyone should pursue their own happiness. I base a large amount of my beliefs on answering two questions: does this action harm the person doing it? Does this action harm others? As long as the answer to both of those questions is no, I see no issue with the activity, even if it is unusual or otherwise outside of the societal norm. When it comes to deciding between two choices, this also comes into play for me. I consider whether one of the choices would do harm to me or others, and if not, I choose the one that feels like it would do the most good for myself and others.

There is only so many hours in a day and then have to play with the dog and take him out etc. Cook clean and always doing something around the house keeps me busy and some days I just want to lay down and watch tv all day but that is not an option in my life or so it seems. I do alot of praying each day and thinking this holiday is sad without my Mother who we lost this year. I lost my brother last year so holidays are very rough for me now. I try to be positive for my son though who also shares a Christmas Eve birthday. I think alot as I go about my daily chores and try to always remember and pray every day about all the beautiful memories my Mother and Brother and my Father who is no longer here as well gave to me. Life is not the same for sure and if I think too much on it it really makes me sad. They would not want me to be sad this I know. But it is hard not to be especially this time of year.,5,3.6666666666666665,4.5,5,4.833333333333333,4.5,4.166666666666667,4,6,4,6,3,6,4,6,6,4,5.5,22,3.3333333333333335,7,3.8333333333333335,1,64,1,English,1,3,R_301v1abxtmmI27i

"Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work. They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to. 
Love, Freedom and Family are three important values in my life. And the major guidelines i use to keep the values are honesty, hard Work, confidence, perseverance.","The past seven days have been so fun for me and my family. It was a week off from work and i had to so much time for family and friends. We started from eating dinner, seeing movies, we also went to re-creation centers which was a whole lot of fun. We went to play basketball, i had a romantic evening with my wife.

"Above all else, I value loyalty. I strongly believe that you truly discover who your true friends are when you encounter a moment of need. If I am in a difficult situation, which rarely happens, I judge my family and friends on how they respond to my need(s) during this period. To be honest, I also judge myself the same way. When my family or friends are in need, I expect myself to assist them in any manner possible. If I don't, I don't consider myself worthy of their love and respect. 

Another important value that guides my life is honesty. If someone won't be honest with you, why in the world would you allow them to continue to be a part of your life? I understand that you can certainly encounter dishonest people that you have no control over, such as people at stores or businesses and work colleagues. Much like loyalty, however, I tend to judge people pretty quickly. If they show themselves to be dishonest in any way, I keep them at a distance or cut them out of my life entirely.","Much of the time I've spent during the past week is very mundane and redundant. I am a creature of habit and enjoy a predictable and well-structured life. 

Last weekend, I spent with my son, who I see every other weekend. We sat around and watched a lot of horror movies, as that's kind of our bonding activity now, since he is a teenager. We ate out a couple of times, fast food one day and pizza another. We also did some necessary chores around my apartment and played a couple of video games together. 

During the last 5 days of my work week, my days don't vary much. I get up, eat a keto-friendly breakfast. Work from home, in my den, until noon. I then go for a 3 mile run at lunch. After lunch, I drink a keto lunch-replacement shake and then work all afternoon. After work, I usually spend about 30 minutes doing resistance exercises. I then eat a healthy dinner. After dinner, I clean the dishes, play some piano, as I'm taking lessons, and then sit and watch TV until I go to bed. I'm usually texting with friends and playing on social media a bit in the evenings as well.",3,1.1666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.3333333333333335,1.5,4.166666666666667,2.6666666666666665,3.5,4,4,4,5,2,4,5.5,4,5,17,2.6666666666666665,5.5,3.8333333333333335,2,42,1,English,1,5,R_1PSG1diW58kFm7D
"Some of the most important values that guide my life have changed over time and some have been constant. I completely believe in the importance of honesty, in dealings with others and oneself. I believe that lies are unnecessary, and that the truth is neither good nor bad. I believe that it is important to always have an open mind. It is important to be curious about things and people and take all aspects of them into account. The funny thing is that you usually learn something about yourself in the process. I also believe that there is something good in everyone, so no one should be treated as a bad person. If you don't like someone, don't be around them. And lastly, my most odd belief and value is that God is my best friend. And I treat him as such. I say ""hey how ya doin'?"" and ""whassup."" I ask how his day went. I find that much nicer than constantly asking him for this and that without even so much as a how do you do.","Beginning a week ago, I did my usual routine of work/home stuff. On Friday, I got paid and got my Christmas bonus which was cool. That evening my boyfriend came over and we hung out and got drunk and I made dinner (lemon butter shrimp and broccoli.) The next morning we went to a diner for breakfast and then hung out for the rest of the day and watched movies and made out. We accidentally missed choir practice but made it to church the next day. I went and did some work that afternoon and then we hung out that evening. Monday started the whole work/home routine again. I was reminded that Christmas is almost here so I ordered a present from Amazon for my boyfriend which was delivered Thursday. Its a tracker for his keys and his wallet. He is always losing things! On Wednesday we drank a little too much and went to choir practice. I think some people got pissed off but I don't really care. We had fun. Then yesterday, I stayed home and made myself chicken-fried hamburger patties. It's like my comfort food.

"In general, I try to live my best life. I want to raise my daughters as good humans, so I'm strict but I also try to be fun. I discipline when they don't listen, or when they do something that I don't think is correct. I try to treat everyone in my life or that I even come across with respect, as I'd want them to treat me. I also have a rule where I don't put up with anything I shouldn't, as I've experienced a lot of negativity in my life and promised I would never put up with it again. I make mistakes, but I do try to learn from them as much as possible to avoid making them a second time. It's important for me to set a good example for all of my family, and help however I can. My partner is not good with any technology, so I make it my priority to try to help him figure out bills and other types of stuff to the best of my ability. I believe our children are a big reflection of how their raised, which is why it's important for me to make sure I'm doing as right as I possibly can.","Last weekend, I started the day off as I usually do. I get up, do some work, wake up all 3 of my girls, and get my oldest ready for school for the day. I work a little more, and then get my 2 little ones ready for the day. I get them dressed, brush their teeth, and do their hair. I work a little more, have snack time, then it's my turn to take a shower. I let them play while I clean myself fast. Then I focus on chores. After chores it's lunch time, then nap time for my kids. I put them down for a nap, clean more, and relax for a few minutes. I wake them up, cook dinner, and then bath time. We relax, watch shows/nursery rhymes, and then it's bed time. I spend some time with my partner, and pass out. Over the weekend, we don't have the little ones, so I like to play video games and drink seltzers. This week was my daughter's birthday, so we broke from our usual routine. I kept her home from school, and my mother came to pick us up. We went to get a few birthday freebies I had found, and then drove to a different town to have pizza together.

"My value system was taught to me by my parents. They began me on the road to becoming a good human being. While they were the ones responsible for giving me the basic value system I use today, I have also learned through time and experience what it means to be a good person. My values are based on being a good person. By this I mean that I treat others as I would like to be treated and while that seems a bit simple, it is actually complex. My values go far and beyond that simple phrase. I try to be the person that has integrity and I want to be the person that everyone sees as honest.","The past seven days have been fairly routine with a couple odd ball incidents thrown in for the excitement of it all. I began my week by going to work and doing all of the normal things people do at work. I came home to find that one of our cats was about to die so that night, I stayed up with my cat. He died early the next morning and I buried him in the family pet cemetery. The next day was a terrible day.

"The absolute most important value in life is honesty. I believe in dealing with people straight, and that if they ask me my true opinion, i won't lie, or obfuscate, to soften it. I do not volunteer mean things, I only give my opinion when asked. I believe this has earned me the respect of those people whom I respect. I believe it has also cost me friendships with those who are less than honorable in their words and deeds.

I would say that my next most important value is my compassion. I do not want to ever lose my compassion for others, as I feel this greatly informs my actions. It is better to be taken advantage of for this trait, than to not offer it. I feel too many people are closed off to the plight of others, and the world could be a much better place if we all just showed each other some more compassion. I feel exhibiting my honesty and compassion are who I truly want to be, and I do my best to demonstrate these in my everyday dealings and actions.","This last week for me was quite a busy week, as I had to get surgery for one of my dogs.

"For the past thirty years that I have been on this earth, I've learned about some values that I find very important to me. The first one is honesty, I feel that being honest so important. Trust is very valuable and not something that can be gained back if at all. Next is respect, I treat others how I would like to be treated. It doesn't always mean that I get treated with respect but, I think it has done more good than bad. I admire people that always try to be the bigger person. That's what I try to do in situations where there's a conflict or my patience is being tested. I also value self-discipline and strive for that in my life. It's very easy to get addicted to certain things like food or activities. Practicing self-discipline strengthens the mind. I believe that if you don't have any self-discipline at all, it's a huge weakness that should be worked on. Lastly, I value hard work and always believed in giving 110 percent in anything that I do. It's not always appreciated or noticed but it makes me feel good. I'm not perfect by a long shot but I'm trying. I'm always trying to make better choices and improving on any weaknesses that I might have.","This past week I've been studying for a part-time job that I was interested in.

"My main guide in life is my religion and so is G-d. I follow the laws and guidelines that were passed down for thousands of years. Also, I am conscious of how my behaviour and attitude affects those around me and I strive to leave a good imprint and to bring a smile to people.
Elderly people are an influence on me and I learn from their experiences of life the best I can.

"My family is my first and foremost concern on the daily basis.  I do what I can for all of them.  My pets are next and I care for them with the best of my ability.  As for guiding principles, I am spiritual but belong to no organized religion.  I try to be a good person, I believe in God, I often think what my views of Heaven are and the type or person I want to be.  However, my depression, anxiety, and PTSD does affect a lot of my days and makes everything that much harder.  I also have a couple of very close friends who live in different states. I spend time talking them via the phone, text messages, messenger, or in online video games.","Seven days ago, I had a normal day where I got up, fed the pets, worked on some Christmas projects I'm making as gifts, took my medications, ate breakfast and dinner, while skipping lunch. I worked on the computer via MTurk off an on as I had a chance and ended the evening with a variety of things such as watching videos (news), videos (music), and playing a video game.  All of my days this week have been similar except Sunday was my youngest son's 24th birthday and we had a small get together and family dinner for him.  Monday, I had an appointment for a blood draw at 8AM and a physical therapy appointment at 3PM.  Tuesday, I had an orthopedic doctor appointment for my knee with severe arthritis, got an update on it and a cortisone injection.  That made me jittery for 2 days so I had extra energy to do those Christmas projects. Did a little bit of shopping yesterday to get a few more things I needed for finishing them.

The most important values the govern my life are honest and integrity. I  treat others the way I want to be treated. I think everyone generally knows what is right and wrong. Values are like muscles that must be exercised on a regular basis or else they lose their ability. A person who knows what is right may not have the strength of values to exercise them because their values have become feeble from lack of use.,I usually live a simple life. I eat breakfast and then look at the morning news. I do a few chores and then eat lunch. I then usually relax in the afternoon by reading a book and then taking a nap. I then have a snack and check the news again. I then do a few more chores around the house. I eat supper and then relax by listening to music.

"The most basic value I have is to treat others the way I want to be treated. Bullying and intimidation are tactics of the insecure to make themselves feel better for a time. It is an unacceptable coping mechanism to me. 
Helping others in need is also important. I tend to root for the underdog in many situations and always want to help people who want to succeed.",In the past week I planned a vacation with my partner and made travel arrangements to visit family in the new year. I ordered the last of the Christmas presents and wrapped them when they arrived and put them under the tree.

I personally like to live by honesty. I believe honesty is a very important virtue to have. This creates loyalty and friendship and sustains relationships between people. This value i would say describes me very well and forms who i am. I always try to tell the truth to anyone i meet because i know they deserve it .,This week i started slow as i was bored . I went to work as usual and did my job as usual then went home and stayed with my family. The next day my wife and I had an argument and went to work while i was mad. The next day was as usual but we had reconciled. The next day my son was sick and had to take the day off to take him to the hospital.

"I try to live life by a simple guideline:  Treat other people how you want to, and expect to, be treated.  This involves being honest with everyone, helping out whenever possible, showing empathy and compassion, and spreading love and happiness.  These different aspects all relate to how you treat others and expect to be treated.  It's not necessarily a religious thing (""Do unto others..."") but more of a personal thing.  I don't need religion to tell me what I feel everyone should do out of common sense.  A little respect given, goes a long way to receiving.","In the last seven days, I've done the usual stuff that I do pretty much every other week.  I've brought my son to school with my wife, and picked him up with her as well.  I've worked all day every day until about 5pm, at which time I usually eat some dinner and try to unwind.  After that I'll maybe play with my son, or play video games if he's playing with his friends.  After a little while of that, I'll usually go to bed but read my phone before actually going to sleep.  Sometimes during the day I'll break for lunch, but usually I just keep working through to get more time in.  On some days, I'll also do a workout depending on which day it is and how I'm feeling.  I try to alternate body parts and then take a day of rest between, but sometimes I need more rest than usual.

"The most important values to me are those my parents taught to me, not just as a child, but throughout their lifetimes and my own. Of course the general golden rule one go without saying:  Be kind, be polite, respect others as well as yourself, do right by others, stand up and speak for or defend those who can't do so for themselves. One of the unique things that my parents share with my brother and I when we were young was to do four things each and every day to live a good life. 1) Do something kind for a total stranger. It could be something as simple as smiling and saying hello, or leaving a coin in a candy machine for the next child to find. 2) Do something kind for someone you love. Sometimes it would be do the dishes, laundry or lawnmowing even when it was not expected of you to help out a family member. Other times it could be offering a treat or favorite toy to a best friend, or spending time with elderly grandparents when you'd rather being playing with friends. 3) Do something kind for the world or our community. It could be picking up trash thrown beside a public trash can, or volunteering to help a local group or animal shelter. And last, 4) Do something kind for yourself. It could be use your allowance to buy your favorite candy, spend extra time doing your favorite activity, or just challenge any negative thoughts you've had. The key to the last one, my parents stressed, was that it was not enough to just ""do"" for others, you must also do for yourself. Those simple four things are something I still do 60 years later every single day, and I think most of my core values come from the mainstay of those four actions every day.","Starting a week ago I did my routine daily tasks which include feeding and exercising my pets, working out for 15-20 minutes, having a light breakfast, taking a shower and starting my day. Last week I went to the food store, came home and put my items away. I worked on graphic designs for a few hours, then had dinner with my boyfriend, watched the end of a movie after he left and then went to bed. The next two days I did my daily morning routine, then did some household chores like laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom. I also finished up some Christmas shopping, made a few phone calls, and had take-out dinner with a girl friend. The next thee days I did my normal routine, and then spent several hours on a new research project I contracted to do. One evening I watched a movie when I finished work for the day.

"My most important values are all rooted in my Catholic faith. I believe in living by the 7 virtues, as well as doing unto others as you want done to you. My faith shapes my guiding principles in life. I believe in working hard, as well as the fact if you work hard enough you will be very successful in life. I believe in personal responsibility and independence need to come first. It's shaped me into a very religious, conservative person. I believe that we live by two sets of laws, the law of the land and the law of the Lord. I do my best to not be hypocritical about my values, and to never back down from my faith. I think my core principles have shaped me into a determined, persevering, strong, and enduring person. I've experienced incredible hardship and even devastation in my life and I've never backed down or given up.","I think I've always had a pretty set routine as my base activity, and then I do whatever is needed on top of that. Last Friday feels like a very long time ago, because it's been a very hectic work week. I always get up, get dressed, make the bed, take meds/vitamins and check my email first thing. I got up and went to work, came home, then went for a long run outside. I cooked on Saturday a ham, homemade bread, and sweet potatoes, plus made cheese. I also went to church Saturday evening, as well as spent 2 hrs exercising. Sunday I went for a walk through the community, did some crafting/painting, and cleared out some old items I didn't need any more. Monday is back to the workweek, and I exercised for 2 hrs both indoors and outdoors. I spent some time reading a library book, and ran errands to the library. Tuesday I was ill most of the morning, and then went for a run, cleaned my apartment bathroom and counters, as well as paid bills. Wednesday I spent most of the day working, with breaks to clean my apartment further, as well as do two workouts. Thursday I was up early to get groceries from the store, and spoke with my apartment manager to finish renewing my lease paperwork. I had to gather some documents for her. I reorganized my pantry, read a book, did a long workout indoors, and did budgeting tasks. Because I couldn't sleep last night, I spent some time playing the Sims 4 on my PC. I then got up early this morning, did my usual routine, and got on the computer to go to work, where I've been working since.",3,1.3333333333333333,5,4,4.666666666666667,4.5,4.166666666666667,3.8333333333333335,4,3,4.666666666666667,5,4,2.5,6,6,1,5,26,3.6666666666666665,7,2.8333333333333335,1,31,1,English,12,5,R_21HBNWbr5SRsDm0
"I would say the most central value is to be nice to other people. Even when that might be a hard thing to do. It seems hatred is winning the battle and people must learn to be nice to each other or we will not survive. I also strive for truth and that can be found in studying science and following the dictates that its conclusions would demand. Yes, that is what is most central to me. Being nice to each other, respecting each other, and seeking the truth.","For all of the last seven days, save for one in which we got take-out, I cooked all the dinners for myself and my wife. Spaghetti and meatballs I think was the highlight, but I believe my wife would say it is the fish.
It was about a week ago that I made a day of putting new strings on my two favorite guitars (the alverez-yairi acoustic, and my 'strat') That was time consuming but very satisfying, as new strings tend to be.

"Honesty is the most important value that guides my life. I strive to be honest in everything that I do, even if the truth sometimes hurt. I do this because if I'm honest, I know why I'm doing or saying something, where if I lie, then I have to remember not only the lie, but also why I was lying in the first place.

The second important value in my life is following the rules. It annoys a lot of people and probably makes people see me as not fun, but we have rules for a reason and they should be followed. Life is better when the important rules are followed. These include do no lie, do not kill, do not steal, do not harm others, do not harm yourself, don't speed, don't do drugs, don't drive drunk or high, and so many others.

","Work has been a large part of my last seven days. My boss is out of work due to an illness and as he is in charge of our location, this is a big out. I've been coordinating with our regional vice president to ensure that all tasks and needs of our location are being met. I've also been ensuring that all invoices for payment have been entered as we near the end of the year. This is important so that the budget can be closed out quickly once we enter into 2022.

Aside from work, I've been doing some tasks here on MTurk to earn extra money. I live with my mom and step-father as a caretaker for my mom. We're middle class, but Covid has been effecting that as periodically my stepfather has been out of work. He teaches automotive repair at various sites around the country, and yet again, he has no work until January due to Covid outbreaks. This means that aside from my paycheck, we have no income coming in. I don't earn much with MTurk, but I enjoy it.

As Covid is bad in our area, I have not been going out aside from my private office on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I've been working from home, doing MTurk, and crocheting to try and finish up Christmas gifts. I also did some plastic canvas work to make a small box for my 10 year old niece. She'll love it because not only did I make it for her, but I got her favorite colors of lime green and the rainbow into it.

I've also been struggling to get our holiday lights up outside. I got the windows and door done with pine garland and lights, however the lights and the timer stopped working after two nights. Exchanging that was a pain as for now, I had to buy a third timer and will return the broken one once our Covid numbers are low again.

One thing that I've loved is cooking simple foods here at home for meals. We've had spaghetti with meat sauce, home made pizza with mini pepperonis on them, chicken noodle soup with goldfish crackers in them, and grilled cheese sandwiches. All are extremely simple, but they're also giving me time to work on my holiday craft projects.

The TV has been on some in the background, but more for noise and not because there was something we had to watch on it. There hasn't been. Most of what has been on has been cooking shows, though I did start watching a medieval history documentary.

Cat cuddles have been real this past week. The kittens especially just want to be held and scratched under the chin as they purr and purr. Our oldest cat has wanted pets too. Not as much as the kittens, and she doesn't want to cuddle, but she wants love.

Sleeping is still a problem. The vertigo and balance issues are keeping me from going up to my bed so I've been sleeping on the couch.

Loyalty is one of the most important qualities that someone can have in my opinion. I have very few people that I consider loyal to me and that is the way I want it. Trust is yours until you break it. Once you break trust it is almost impossible to get it back from me. Let people be whoever they want to be. There is no normal for who a person should live by, only the normal they feel for themselves. Conservatives are some of the most judgmental people on earth and is is really disturbing.

"Integrity and groundedness.  

Telling the truth and learning how to navigate life with others in it have taught me that most often, at least for me, the cleanest and fastest outcome comes from telling the truth, and living that truth regardless of whether anyone sees it or acknowledges it.  This practice has led me to something more important over the years, and that's groundedness.  Being truthful to myself and others about everything, even if there are unfavorable consequences has allowed me to become more aware of my surroundings simply by being more aware of people and their feelings.  I have to see it, feel it, be part of it, and accept the good and the bad.

Just making people more ""real"" has afforded me the opportunity to pull my head out of abstractions and intangibles and remember that I'm on a little piece of the universe, surrounded by all of that infinite unknown in all directions, where I get to experience good weather, sunsets, trees blowing in the wind, cuddling, good food, and art. 

It comes with pain, but that's okay.  It's all part of it, and it's just as much part of it to make it as close to heaven on earth as possible by reducing that pain for each other.  

For me, that starts with just simply having integrity and showing people that I care enough about them to be honest and treat them with compassion.","Most of my days currently consist of taking care of my father.  As in, my days are the same for months at a time.

"I have what I call ""The Pillars of Success in Life"".

1. God
2. Health
3. Family
4. Friends
5. Hard Work
6. Interaction with The Natural World
7. Learning
8. Teaching
9. Giving
etc.

There are many but the ones listed above are some of the most important ones.

I use The Basic 3 Love Rule to guide everything I do.

1. Love God
2. Love Yourself - The humble type of love for self.
3. Love Others as you Love Yourself

I have practiced them and have realized that they come in that order. In other words, I must first Love God in order to Love Myself. I must Love God and Love Myself (the humble type) in order to Love Others as Love Myself.

These 3 Loves are very easy to understand and ""to see"". The hardest one, at least for me and for many people in my life, ""Love Others as you Love Yourself"" is by far The Hardest One of the 3 Loves. Very hard at times, especially for those we see as ""Unlovable"". 

After the 3 Loves, I think everything, including the 3 Loves, are based on Relationships. That is the key. We have relationships in our immediate and extended families, our neighbors, at school, at work, in our community, our Healthcare Providers, etc. Relationships are everything.

Now, Relationships are maintained and grow by communicating. Listening is the most important aspect of communicating. Most of us are really bad at listening. Especially active listening.

I also believe in interacting and taking care of the Natural World and all Living Things. Admiring them, respecting them, understanding that we are a part and not above The Natural World.  My parents have taught us that we must leave the world better than we found it. Improve it. Don't make it worse. 

Learning is a must and we all do it to some extent. But, teaching, or sharing what we learn is the next most important part of learning. Just learning is not enough. We can ""hoard"" knowledge and think we have the upper hand for doing so but no. It is actually the opposite. Because, others will not share their knowledge with us if we ""hoard"". And, more importantly, what we learned was written or said by others, for the most part. Also, teaching or sharing reinforces what we learn and makes it ""stick"". It also increases our Networks and keeps us more connected.

My oldest brother taught me, mostly through his actions, the 3 S's of money. 

1. Save Some
2. Share Some
3. Spend Some

With these 3, and in that order, we will have enough money. I can tell you that it works. I have seen it work in his life, in my life and in the lives of others in our circles. 

I value my Health and know it is a Gift from God and is not to be taken for granted. Health and Wellness make everything better and easier (not easy but easier). We should eat nutritiously, exercise daily, yes daily... even a 20 min walk is exercise. We should also stay connected and interact with God, people and The Natural World. All these things bring us and give us Health. 

Laughter is very important. It literally heals (Science has proven it). We must keep that ""Childlike"" aspect of our lives and have fun. As adults, we are very serious due to work, responsibilities, marriage, children etc. That is true. But we must have fun with those around us and always be willing and able to laugh.","These past 7 days I worked for 5 days in my regular job. It is very challenging and satisfying. Our work and the people we work with are ""like our second family"". Work and the relationships at work and belonging to a Big Group with a common cause brings me great satisfaction and identity.

I also go to the LA Fitness gym about 4-5 times week to do Cardio Workout, Lift Weights and to Play Basketball. I also socialize with my gym friends and acquaintances and with the gym Staff. The gym is a big stress reliever for me and brings me good Health. My connections and relationships at the gym are unique and ""Athletic"". We all have a common interest. Sports and being and staying in shape.

I also go to the local park with my girlfriend. We do this about 3-4 times a week and for about 45-60mins on weekdays and for about 1-1.5hrs on weekends. This is a great time to walk and talk outside with the trees and the wind around us. Really good way to see things from a different perspective. Our conversations are somewhat different when we ""talk while we walk"". It's one of our sayings...""talk while we walk"". Very different than talking in the car, at home, in a restaurant etc.

I keep in touch with close friends and with extended family through Social Media, phone calls, facetime etc.  This is very important to me and I make time, even if it's just a 15-20 min phone call or a quick 5 min text.  I'm an Extra Extrovert and simply enjoy talking and interacting with people from All Walks of Life. 

Some of the Social Activities are limited now due to the Delta and Omicron Variants. This whole Pandemic that started around Feb 2020 has impacted All The World and has limited a lot of our Social Interactions, at least the physical ones. I have kept, we have kept an eye on the current Omicron Variant. About 90% of my immediate and extended family and my friends believe in The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA Vaccines. We are all fully vaccinated and in the process of getting our Boosters. We stay informed, share the info with one another, encourage each other and provide help finding Booster Shot locations, Appointments etc.

We are not discouraged and we don not live in a world of ""doom and gloom"". We simply stay informed, Trust but Verify the information and follow the Science. We are lucky to have some Doctors, Nurses and Pharmacists in our Extended Family. They bring perspective and give us another Opinion or more importantly, they summarize and ""filter"" some of the information.

I am looking forward to our Annual Family Christmas Gathering. Some will attend in person and others will be via Zoom/FaceTime. It's due to the Delta and Omicron Variant. It will be better than Christmas 2020 but not as good as Christmas 2019 and all those before that.",4.333333333333333,4,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,4.166666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.5,4.5,4,6,3.5,5.5,6,5,6,4,5.5,25,3.6666666666666665,5,4.5,2,31,1,English,16,5,R_3nVKZhvMjcoJd7X
"I try to put myself in other shoes to understand them before responding to deep ideas. General conversation isn't really important yet I still strive to be supportive of the people I interact with.

"The most important values that guide my life:
Never hold a grudge against anyone. Put others first before your needs. Bear wrongs patiently, Help those in need. Provide insight and guidance to others. Act always out of charity towards others especially when they are not kind to you.  I strive to follow all Christian values and virtues each and every day and pray each day for the wisdom and courage.  Each time that i exercise a virtue such as patience, kindness, or generosity, i feel happy and try to keep up the virtue. If I feel sad or without motivation I mediate on the events in the 4 Gospels and this helps me. I always look for the most logical choice when a decision is to be made and pray about my choices. I try to be understanding and thoughtful to others.","During the past seven days i have done the following 
On Dec 10th I did not work my regular job. Instead I volunteered to help backstage with the production of a nutcracker ballet performance. I was in charge of a ""prop"" a sleigh that is used in both Acts I and II. During Act I the sleigh is changed from the brown sleigh to  a white one and I made the ""costume"" change during the act for this ""prop"". I also helped move some parts of the set during a scene change. After the show was over I drove back to my apartment and fell asleep.
On Dec 11th, I volunteered again to help backstage. I generally did the same things except there were two shows today so everything was repeated. However I did not need to help with the set change since there were more people available to help. My lower back started to hurt some during the day after I refilled some of them at the Whole Foods Grocery during the morning of the 11th.
On Sunday December 12, I also volunteered at 2 shows but these were a little earlier in the day so I arrived back at my apartment earlier than on Friday or Saturday. I also helped with the ""seligh"" ""Prop"" in both of these shows getting it changed during Act I.On
On Monday December 13,  I went back to my regular routine: getting up in the morning, eating breakfast and doing my remote work. I also took a lunch break at 12 noon on both days.
On Tuesday I drove my daughter to the ballet theater for her lesson with the artistic director and then returned to my apartment.
ON Wednesday, I also drove my daugher to the ballet for a dress rehearsal.
On Thursday I drove again to the ballet theater for the 6th show of the Nutcracker. I also volunteered backstage. My lower back continues to hurt but only in certain positions.
Now it is Friday and I am getting ready for another show. I decided to stay at a nearby hotel last night so I could be close to the theater today and not drive back late at night after the show.",4.833333333333333,2.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.333333333333333,3.5,4,5,2,6,3,5,3,6,5.5,2.5,4.5,24,3.6666666666666665,4,4.666666666666667,2,50,1,English,1,7,R_31cOOeTEtKBITck
"I'm not a religious person, but I do believe I have a moral compass that helps guide me through life and allows me to share many of the same values that people with religious beliefs hold dear. One of my main values is compassion because I hate seeing others struggle, so anything I can do to help ease their burdens, I will try my best to do so. Another value I believe I have is loyalty. I feel that this is a very important value that seems lost in society today, whether it's personal or professional, you should always show loyalty to those that deserve it and show loyalty in return.","I'm a very boring person, so my daily activities don't change much.

"I base my entire thought process about life based on the life of Jesus.  What he taught us and how we are supposed to treat each other.

He taught us to be kind to one another.   And not just to our friends and family.  Be kind, even unto your enemy.  Turn the other cheek etc.  He taught us to care about the things he cared about, which is His people.  

He taught us to have integrity.  Do not promise or swear to someone.  Let your yes be yes and your no be no.  Do not guarantee things that you have no control over.  Be honest to people about all things.

He taught us to teach our children about him and let them grow through the years learning from Him.  He wants us to teach our children about His love, the Agape love.",On last Friday I went to work all day.  I got home and had a quiet night eating supper and playing with the family.  Saturday we got up and went to town and did some shopping most of the day.  we ate out for lunch at a fast food restaurant and went and purchased clothes for the children.  On Sunday we got up earlier than usual and went to my brother-in-law's church to watch his daughter and son in a Christmas performance.  We went shopping again and made it home in time to go to our church for Sunday night service.  Monday I had my typical day at work.  When I got home I took my son to the batting cages to work on baseball since his tryouts were this week.  Tuesday-today were pretty much the same.  Work all day and play with the kids at night.

I try to lead my life in such a way as to use these two attributes in every decision and interaction I have with people. I'm not perfect, I'm not the smartest or most talented person in the world, but the one thing I have some control over is my integrity. I try to make my word count. I don't make promises unless I have every intention of fulfilling them. I am honest with people. If I can't say something nice, I won't say anything. I take responsibility for my actions and decisions. If I make a mistake, I am willing to admit it.","This past week I have gone to work several days.

"I have several central and important values that guide my life.  I first value self-reflection and knowing myself.  I know that with all my flaws and judgments, I have a sense of self-awareness that I want to cultivate in my daily life so that I can become empowered to truly be aware of my thoughts and my actions, and thus be able to change things that don't serve me.  Engaging in daily meditation helps with this immensely.  To that end, I find that becoming less self-judgmental and more loving towards myself and others is a guiding principle that I want to incorporate more of in my life and interactions with others.  I also find that when I make decisions, I want to rely more on my intuition and gut-feeling, becoming aware of when something feels off or wrong versus right.  Getting into this space of awareness helps me become more empowered in making good decisions and positively impacting myself and those around me.","This last week I began each day by oil pulling with coconut oil, then carrying out my daily morning ablutions like brushing my teeth and washing my face.  I then make my bed, take the first drink of water for the day, and then eat my breakfast, which typically consists of English muffins and vegan cream cheese, and a fruit smoothie bowl.  I then get to work on my laptop at my desk at home by going online and studying.  I am studying with an online Yoga teacher training course.  I take snack and water breaks in between.  I usually eat yogurt or a sandwich as a snack.  Later I stop to take a lunch, usually consisting of a falafel burger or a rice and sprouted beans meal.  I then get back to studying in the afternoon, or I take a bit of time to meditate.  In the evenings for the last, I have prepared dinner, usually consisting of a rice and sprouted beans combo or gazpacho.  I then carry out my evening ablutions and then take a rest to watch a movie or read a relaxing book before going to bed.

My central and most important values that guide my life are simple. Everyday is a gift and sometimes I have to remind my self of that . I try to do healthy things daily and eat healthy and laugh even if its my own silly jokes. Im no saint and Im still more than capable of giving someone a piece of my mind if I perceive it necessay. I try not to be overbearing in my adult childrens lives but I do try to make sure they are living healthy. Im not overly friendly to stranger im actually slightly distrustful of them . I watch our political system and worry about America losing it Democracy it seems we are on the edge of the cliff teetering towards facisim or Replican Mafia whatever they have going. Also the cultural makeup of our country is changing and im worried about the countries ability to think rationally and not religiously.,cereal and coffee at 6am followed by surveys for at least an hour everyday. The the every morning walk with my wife which is 3.2 miles and takes about an hour . By then its lunch time we usuall eat around 11:30am and that will take a good hour after that I practice mandolin and guitar in my music room usually 2 hours. We eat supper around 4:30pm and then watch the news till 6pm - then I go to bed and watch horror movies till my wife comes in at about 7:30 pm .

"My core values as a person are to be the best mother I can possibly be and to be the best wife I can be. See I grew up with an alcoholic mother and a father that was never there for us. He was always out of town working. As I have gotten older and so has my child. I have learned things from being a child that have reminded me over and over again what to not be to my child. My parents were very abusive towards me and my siblings. Today I refuse to hit my child in anyway. Growing up back then versus growing up today is so different in so many ways. I know that I'm a great mother. I know this because my child isn't afraid of me. She isn't afraid for her well being. I do the best I can every single day for my child. I would do anything under this sun to give my child the live she deserves. I would even give my life to her, if it came down to it. 
Being a good wife. I have not always been good to my husband. I have done terrible things. Things he should hate me for. Things he should have walked away from. But he didn't. That man has stuck by me through my ugliest and my prettiest. And every since I did what I did, I have done everything in my power to make it up to him. I can't explain the feelings I have for my husband, we'd be here all day, but just know I can't live without this man. He has pulled me out of the worst of the worst mental states I have ever experienced. For that I own this man my life. I live everyday to do what I can to make him happy. I do everything I can, so he doesn't have to. I would walk through hell if I knew he didn't have to. I would also give my life for that man. He has loved me like no other person on this planet has. And let me tell you, I love him like no other on this planet. And I will continue to do so, till my last breath.","A week ago today was Friday. So to start off I woke up and made myself a cup of coffee. After my coffee was done I proceeded to wake my daughter up and get her ready for school. After she was done getting ready for school and ate breakfast we were off to the bus stop. At the bus stop we talk about what she is going to do in school and how she is going to act at school. During the day, while she is at school, is when I get all my house chores done. My house chores consist of me taking the dog out 3 times a day, washing clothes for myself, my husband and my daughter, washing dishes, putting dishes away, cooking dinner, cleaning the floors, scooping the cat boxes, feeding the cats and if I have time, I try and squeeze a nap in there. When my daughter arrives home from school, me and her together will eat a snack out of her snack box. After she gets that done we start on homework. Her homework includes me and her reading either one or two books together and then she will take a test on the books that we read together. I will sit with her in case she needs any help. Normally she doesn't. But I am there if she needs me. After homework is done, me and her will start on our chores. At this specific time of day I know what I have to do and she knows what she has to do. So she goes on and does her thing, while I go and do my thing. After chores are done, I will start on dinner. While I'm cooking dinner I normally wash dishes as I dirty them from cooking. If my husband is home we will sit down together with no phones or electronics. But normally it's just me and my daughter. She prefers that we eat together but with electronics. So during this time, I will watch Netflix and she will watch YouTube. After we have ate our dinner we tend to sit there for awhile watching whatever it is we are watching. Mainly for our food to settle. Another because we don't really want to do anything else for the day. We've both had long and stressful day, so it's nice to just sit and watch something on our phones or tablets. But eventually we have to get back to reality and finish up our chores and get ready for the end of the day. The end of the day entails her taking a bath and me taking a shower. After that I put my daughter down in bed for the night. I usually finish up and chores I have not finished or gotten to for the day, while I wait for my husband to get home from work. When he gets home, I sit with him for a few hours and we talk about our day. How his day was at work and how my day was at home. After that I get myself ready for bed and my husband tucks me in for the night. I wake up the next morning and do it all over again.

"One of my central values is to treat people the way that I want to be treated. When people are rude and mean or don't agree with me, I try to make sure the way I behave towards them reflects respect. I feel that this may be a way to be a positive influence on others. That perhaps they will see that there is no need to be rude or argumentative. It is important to me that there is peace and calmness in my life. If this means walking away from arguments, then that is what I do. It is important to me that I follow the rules of social norms as much as I can. I do not want to offend anyone or make them feel uncomfortable. I value other people and their feelings.","I went to work 4 days and after work on each of those days I came home and took a shower and then made dinner for my husband and myself.

"One of my core values is to do best not to judge. Have empathy. Although everyone judges to a certain degree, it is important not to let any preconceived judgements cloud your perception of who someone really is and their potential. I grew up abused and bullied due to being a bit different in things I liked, styles I enjoyed, and hobbies. It affected me for the rest of my life. In my earlier years, I coped with what happened to me by using drugs, which led to an addiction. I am now 4 years sober, and I often see how people at their lowest are judged. People look at me and see someone strong, but sometimes they don’t know my past and make comments about people who are just like how I used to be. It’s important to me to speak up for them, and show that everyone has value. Just because someone doesn’t fit your idea of a successful life, or doesn’t fit your religious checkpoints - they are not less than you. Everyone has value and potential, and until we as a society can openly take a look at what causes addiction and other behaviors society looks down on - we won’t ever be able to reduce it. Instead of looking at people as hopeless or wastes of life, people need to have some empathy and ask what got them to that point, and lend out a helping hand.","I have been working mostly, Monday through Friday. I work at a bubble tea shop, and I also have been training in an employee on how to close. I got a new Gaming PC, so every night after work I’ve been playing 7 Days to Die with my friend.

"For me, recently I found that one of the most important values of my life is my family. I didn't realize how important my family was to me until recently when my grandfather passed away and my grandmother moved away (rejecting the rest of her family). It made me realize how important family was to me. Not only that, but how important time also is. We are only here on this earth for a very short amount of time. We should spend every minute doing the things we love and spending time with the people we love. We aren't promised tomorrow and we should live every day like it's our last. Make sure to tell the people you love that you love them when you have the chance. Do you want to be remembered for your contributions to your work or how much you cared about those around you?

"A few of my most central and important values that really stand out for me is 1: always be honest. I cannot stand being lied to, not told the whole truth because of nefarious reasons anything that is a lie i simply cannot tolerate. I even tell someone ""I do not care how bad it is please just tell me the truth and i will not get mad at you. NO matter how bad it is, no matter what and you have my word"" AND i mean it and anyone who has known me for a while and knows me for me knows that's the truth..And STILL when I know 100% without a doubt what the truth is this person will still look at me and lie right to my face. Is it post to be a significant part of my life. So i have been rather emotional about that especially lately. Battling it inside of me of what to do. I probably could've let it go once but four or five times? NO! I can't do it anymore... Honesty is what growing up the matter what just told the truth because wise always come back and make things worse. So I hold myself to a moral standard being honest. I feel betrayed and I feel like this certain person is trying to get one over on me but why would they lie if they weren't trying to hide something bigger..","My entire last seven days has not honestly been very exciting.

"The most important values in my life are action over inaction and making sure I am not living life passively. For the first, I simply believe that it is one thing to hold a belief or to speak so easily about something but a more important next step is to really live those beliefs. For example, we hear a lot about being anti racist or pro environment and I know many people talk about how these beliefs are important to them but i'm more interested in how we can show these through organizing or community action or writing to local politicians about how these topics impact the community. I try to live my beliefs when I can and I know it's a huge privilege to be able to do so and not face repercussions on my job or my living situation. With work especially, diversity, equity, and inclusion are extremely important to me and I show up during meetings ready to discuss why these things are or are not happening in the spaces I take up.","Here is a list of things I did in the past week: went to sleep, cleaned my kitchen, cleaned my bathroom, watered the plants that sit in the windowsill of my living room, made my bed, brushed my teeth, brushed my hair, washed my face, applied lotion to my face, applied sunscreen to my face, put on clothes, put on shoes, walked on the sidewalk, rode on an elevator, took public transportation, went through a security line at an airport, drank a smoothie, rode on an airplane, read a book, rode in a car, decorated a Christmas tree, spent time on my laptop, showered, attended work meetings, composed and sent work emails, attended a diversity, equity, and inclusion seminar, talked to a friend about college, ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, played a video game, exercised, and spent time with family.",4.666666666666667,4.5,2.3333333333333335,1.5,2.8333333333333335,2.1666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,2,4.5,5.5,5.666666666666667,3.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,5.5,9,3.1666666666666665,2,2.6666666666666665,1,27,6,English,13,6,R_Or3XbqYs1J40CoF

"My central values in life are to be comfortable and do as little harm as possible. Being comfortable is easy and, in the way I do it, makes doing less harm easier in many ways. As much as I love my work, it's not the center. My time is too precious for that, so I, and my spouse, aren't striving to be rich. I stay home a lot because that is a comfortable space. We both tend to keep to ourselves and maintain a mellow and relaxed home space. 

Reading and studying contribute to both my comfort and trying not to be a jerk. I enjoy both, but I also think that they help me to understand others better and to understand the impact of my actions better. I often encounter ideas and perspectives that I would not have found otherwise.

It's also easier not to do harm when I don't go out and around other people. I find it hard to understand what they want, and I'm definitely not the greatest at turning the other cheek. I'm not a particularly vengeful person-I won't hunt anyone down to get even or carry a grudge-but if you slap me, I'll slap you right back without thinking.

When I do get around folks, I do my best to try to recognize that they probably mean no harm. I also try to perform spontaneous acts of kindness when I can. Compliments, jokes, listening. Whatever I can think of that might put a smile on someone's face or make them feel good for a minute. 

In the end though, I'd just as soon be home with my books and spouse.","Last Saturday was unusual for me because I normally work on that day. However, I injured myself somehow and woke up in a lot of pain on that morning. As soon as it was a reasonable time of day to do so--I typically wake up between 6 and 7am, I contacted my boss. My right shoulder hurt so badly that even turning the pages of a book was unpleasant and painful. So I spent most of the day under a blanket with my arm propped up on a pillow to help stabilize it. I watched a LOT of TV since I couldn't do anything. I watched a play through of Resident Evil 2 from Leon's perspective, one episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, and then 6 episodes of Squid Game. I also very carefully stretched my arms at some point to ease the pain. I took ibuprofen throughout the day. 

Sunday, I felt better and didn't hurt, but I was carefully not to use the arm so as not to re-injure it. I studied and read most of the day. I studied both Thai and Spanish. I read from multiple books including The Portable Sixties Reader and The Blacktongue Thief. I also finished Squid Game because it was AMAZING.

Monday was another off day, and I was able to straighten up the house. As is typical of me, I studied both Thai and Spanish as well as reading through the variety of books I'm currently reading. I started a new audiobook that day, The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. I also had a hearing aid cleaning appointment that afternoon, and after that, I treated myself to a poke bowl.

Tuesday was a work day, and it was pleasant and peaceful. I saw Rida on the bus in to work that day, and there was some excitement as a man, who was being nasty and abusive to the driver, had to be thrown off the bus. All the regular riders had a good time joking and gossiping about it after he was off. I enjoy my job and the company of my coworkers, so I typically like going to work. All of our patrons were pleasant, so while it was busy, I had a good day. I brought in homemade hot cocoa mix for all of my coworkers. Tuesdays are long for me so I typically go to bed within an hour of going home. Staying up long enough only to eat, prepare my clothes for the next day, and brush my teeth. I ate ratatoille (sp?) with Italian sausage as well as black beans and rice with sweet potatoes that day.

Wednesday was great. On Wednesdays, I get to see all of my coworkers and I love that. Our boss bought us delicious pizzas and salads that day. Additionally, two patrons brought us some boxes of candy and one of our coworkers brought a tasty Chex Mix. When I got home I relaxed with a tasty hot cocoa to which I added some Dark Rum. I read and chatted with my spouse and snuggled my cat.

Thursday as usual, I cleaned the whole house. I'm off that day, and I like to get everything done in one day if possible. I washed my laundry, cleaned the bathrooms, etc. I read and studied in between rounds of housework. I worked out at some point. I sent my husband the grocery list via text, and, as is our wont, he picked up pizza on the way home and we both curled up to eat pizza and watch British comedy.

"The most important thing to me in life is honesty, I think it is important to tell people the truth. We should avoid hurting other people, just like we wouldn't want them to hurt us. Another important value is advocacy. I am forced to get a COVID vaccination even though I truly do care for my patients, i have to get something that I disagree is right for my life. I will always advocate for my patients and never, ever force them to do something they are uncomfortable with. I think it is important to have faith. Without it, the world can become even darker than it already is, and that can be scary. Faith is a very important value in my life to keep me afloat.","Over the last seven days I have...

"My values: when I was 16 I almost died because I was put in a hospital to find out what my health problems were. They wanted to do one weeks worth's of test but they over dosed me on something they had given me, that I was already over dosed on. So, the one thing I would have regretted was, there were people in my life, I loved and I hadn't told them. So, when I got out of the hospital I let those I loved and cared about, that I loved them. That is my main guiding principle. So, I have lived my life, with gratitude for another day, letting those I love know. 
Other core values: be true to yourself, be honest, I am dependable, hard working. Treat people with respect. I believe GOD is in every human being and to treat all people fairly, respectfully and kindly. 
Try to walk through this life, without causing or occurring any karma. 
We may not be able to control what happens in our life but we can control how we react to things. So, that is one of the reasons, I meditate. 
I feel I have lived 3 lives: my childhood were I had health problems.
I learned to control and heal those health problems through natural methods: a good organic vegan diet, exercise, yoga and meditation. Then I had my work life: were I worked for others and then had my own business which I lost in 2008 financial downturn. I did my best but the economy changed and I accepted that. Then waiting to get to receiving early social security I was almost homeless. I was lucky and fortunate that a new friend let me rent her 2nd bedroom. I only had about $700 to my name. I had to get through 3 months and found a little job that helped me make it to social security. To me at my age: my spiritual life is more important to me now. I am looking not so much to the material side of things. Peace of mind, making a connection with that creative energy in all of us, whatever you want to call it: GOD etc. 
That is more important and helping were I can.","Last Friday, got up and did my normal routine: go to the bathroom, brush my hair and tie it in a pony tail, brush teeth, shower. Drink some water, do some exercises and stretching. Then I did my morning meditation on breath and such. Then I have 1 cup of blueberries, that have thawed, which I prep before my meditation. Then I turn on my computer and look at my emails, the news, check Mechanical Turk for possible HITs. Depending on the day, I might do some chores: getting RO water filled in 3 one gallon containers. On Friday my veggies and fruits are delivered from a local organic farm. They arrived early that Friday and I put them away. I started to make my lunch around 11AM. I have been making a winter soup: onions, ginger, garlic, a potato diced, couple of celery ribs chopped, a carrot diced, some cauliflower diced, broccoli diced and a shiitake mushroom. As it continues to cook, I add spices: tumeric, basil, thyme, sage.  After about 10 minutes we add some chopped cabbage or leafy green for a few more minutes. Then we take it off the burner and add: miso, tahini and about 2-3 TBSN of nutritional yeast. To this I will add 2 heaping spoonfuls of salsa. I take my vitamins before I have my lunch. I enjoy this soup and it keeps me in good health with a strong immune system. I may tweak a bit. After lunch, I check Mechanical Turk for HITs and try to meet my daily goal.  During the afternoon, I will check what is on my to do list for that day, check Youtube, get some chores done: take out the trash, read my current book, do some tasks for my local cooperative. I think I watched a movie on Roku last Friday. I usually stop eating for the day around 4PM. So, if I am hungry, I think I had a homemade Rubin Sandwich, which I love. I make my own wheat free bread, so I grabbed a couple of slices. I put about 1/4 package of tempeh in the oven for 10 minutes on one side and then turned it over for another 5 minutes. I had the bread toasting and took that out, put mustard on it, took the tempeh out of the oven and put that on the bread. I put a couple of slices of dill pickle on it and then topped it off with my homemade purple sauerkraut. Uhmm that was good eating, done before 4PM. I checked Mechanical Turk for HITs, then did some BrainIQ excercises to stay sharp and played some online Mahjongg games on AARP website.  When the sun starts to go I do another meditation for about 20 minutes. 
After that I check for possible HITs, check Youtube again and watch Glenn Kirschner each evening for his opinion regarding Trump's investigations etc.
I usually get some evening news items via my email, from people I trust for accurate news. Will watch some fun youtube videos till I start to get tired, which is around 9PM. Do one last meditation before I go to bed.

"I wish that I could say that I have completely pulled myself through this period of not knowing who I am, however in contrast, the struggle to regain solid ground has been all uphill and the burden of feeling lost in my world became magnified, more confused, and a period of testing that I am not even sure how I survived this time, except by the grace of God and the support of my daughters and friends. I am confident, however, that these trials that I have been going through are going to work out for the good, eventually.","A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.

"I think that in one sense, the most important value that guides my life is objectivity. The more I experience life, the more I seek to understand what is actually happening. What happens, happens. Objective reality doesn't depend on my mind to conceive it or to understand it. It just is. Admittedly, this value leads me to a place some would find ironic. It leads me to meditate often on Christianity, not as a political movement or a particular sect, although to be sure as a human person I count myself among a group of people who are, or seek, or claim to be like-minded. Rather, I meditate on Christianity as being the desire to imitate Christ. One of my favorite writers and opinion journalists typically writes about politics, but he occasionally has fascinating insights into faith. He has written about the need for Christians to understand that we believe audacious, implausible, radical things. That is undoubtedly true. But if I believe what I believe, I do it because I believe that Christ is the Nexus between humanity and the Divine. He is ultimate reality. His simultaneous humanity and Divinity simply are, whether I believe that or can understand it.","Last Friday I did some laundry, sent an email to my boss, and went to the gym. I had lunch and packed a duffel bag, said goodbye to my wife and began to drive to Fort Worth to see my father. On the way to Fort Worth I stopped to get a haircut and buy a beer. I had another drink upon arriving in Fort Worth then went to my father's house. I spent the night and on Saturday morning I went to a gym there so see several friends. I spent the afternoon sitting and talking with my father, watching golf on TV. Then I checked into a hotel and got ready to go to a friend's birthday party. I met my friends for the birthday dinner and had ceviche and tacos. We had a few drinks and then went dancing. I had a lot of fun. I went back to the hotel and fell asleep watching TV. On Sunday I went to the gym and took a kickboxing class. I went to lunch and had a chicken sandwich and some beer. I talked to the bartender about her perfume and how it smells almost indistinguishable from a much more expensive perfume that another friend of mine wears. Both perfumes are tenacious, almost obnoxious and have become very popular, so I smell them seemingly all the time. I drove back home and had dinner with my wife. I played with our new dog. On Monday I woke up and drove to pick up a different dog that belongs to a friend because I'd be pet sitting the dog while my friend and her husband returned from a vacation in Mexico. I answered a call from my wife and had a conversation about a thankfully minor car accident that she was in that afternoon. I sat and wondered how we were going to fit the car repairs into our budget. That night I met a friend at a concert. We talked about our wives and how they seem to never want to come out with us. On Tuesday I worked from home, then went to the gym, then got home and worked some more. On Wednesday I spent most of the morning at the gym until I returned home. I worked hard at my regular job and occasionally did some Mturk work when I needed a break. Yesterday morning I went to the gym and taught my kickboxing class. I met my wife at her office for their Christmas party. I had some barbecue then went home and started working to finish an important project for work.

I try to incorporate my values into all dealings with people I know from my wife to my friends to my acquaintances.

I sit down at the computer and check emails and work daily remotely for a few hours as I do marketing for a real estate group.
Some of the special things that I have done over the past week includes:
Last Friday, I drove to Arizona with my best friend and visited my brother and his wife. I had not seen them since January 2020, so it was a very nice experience.  We ate out and talked and laughed, decorating their tree! 
My best friend's birthday was Saturday, so we took her to a nice restaurant and had a wonderful birthday dinner.  We spent time talking, laughing and sharing many stories as we had not spent time together for over a year since the pandemic started.
My friends and I watched football on Sunday all day, which is one of the biggest activities I do on Sundays!  I played my fantasy football teams and didn't win but had a wonderful time doing it.   We barbequed steak and chicken for dinner, as well as for snacks during the week.
On Monday, my wife and I went out to breakfast with our nextdoor neighbors. We went to a restaurant at a golf course; it was relaxing and very scenic with the course and mountains. Later in the day, I took one of my cats for a checkup at the vet.  She is doing well!
I haven't done any other special things the rest of the week except for taking a walk in the evenings after dinner and then going to bed tired each evening!

The most important value I hold is honesty. I value honesty above all else. I believe practicing honesty and transparency is what bonds people together and creates a strong foundation for a lifelong relationship. Tied into that is reliability- being able to rely on someone to be honest with you and be there for you in your darkest moments.,"Early in the week I spent several hours cooking and preparing meals that my husband and I would eat throughout the work-week. I made loaded potato soup, vegetarian stir fry, and thee-cheese lasagna. Mid-week I had begun to clean the house in the evenings after work in preparation for guests during the holidays.

"The central value that guides my life is my belief in Jesus and following His teachings and virtues. I think that guides my behavior at work, my choice in marriage partner, the way I raise my children, even interactions and choices with friends. For the most part it's just consistent with living a moral life respectful of others, but every now and then I am aware of how different it might be from others approaches. For instance, I have a very diverse group of friends, my two closest friends are Muslim and Jewish respectively; they recently invited me to a movie with them but I declined. I stated that it wasn't my thing, but the reality is that it was not to my taste because I believe in only presenting to my eyes and ears subjects that promote my values, not degrading/immoral/trashy/scary things that promote the devil's work. I do not wish to offend and I pass no judgement on those who do not find it to be so; good for them for resisting that way. I know myself and don't want to let the devil in, I'm not strong enough, so I avoid it.","In the last week I have done many things. It's the holiday season, so yes we are doing our every day activities of going to work, exercising, reading, and eating dinner as a family, but we are also doing some special activities.

We went to our church's holiday themed ""Family Night"" and had dinner, read a story, made crafts, and had treats. We went to tour the ""largest Christmas attraction"" in Texas, Santa's Wonderland, on Sunday. It was very fun but very crowded and the cost was basically a car payment.

"A huge guiding factor in my life is if something will benefit or hurt me based on my actions or the decisions I make. Before I do or decide anything, I really take a step back and evaluate what it is that I am trying to accomplish. If its going to be beneficial in any way, I go ahead and decide for it. However, I also look into the future possible outcome of said decision. Its like a Yes or No algorithm scheme. I run through the scenarios that a decision might lead to, then what that will lead  to, and so on. This to me feels like the safest route. I do sometimes go with the flow, but I more likely than not think about my actions before I do them. I don't do it slowly either.

"The central and most important values that guide my life are, remembering that we will soon be dead and it will all be over, and to focus only on what I'm doing.

"One day, a man who I knew quite well, stopped me outside the library and told me that I was the MOST serious person he knew. I really didn't question him about his opinion of me, but I've spent considerable time over the last 15 years since that incident. 
I consider myself a pretty jovial person and light hearted but there what it made me do is look at those issues that I take VERY seriously.
Of those are, the treatment of those who are disadvantaged, whether it's related to race, gender identification, child/spousal abuse as well as other discriminatory practices.
I know that I can be very passionate when it come to child abuse and have started groups that discuss abuse and what we as a community can to do recognize it and to take action to keep if from happening. 
More recently with the killing of George Floyd and the BLM movement I have attended protests on the streets and have spent considerable amount of time bringing up issues/incidents on my Facebook page, and quite often stepping back and watching to see how others interact and often watching things turn into very heated debates. I often try to stay out of it, but at times almost have to step in as a referee. 
I tend to side with the ecology movement especially as it relates to our forests and oceans, and of climate change. Even though I'm of very simple means, I will take and contribute money to such organizations such as Green Peace and the Audubon Society. Being someone that is very at home in the out-of-doors in all four seasons, preservation of our environment is essential. 
I could go on..but I'll leave it at that.","For the past month, I have been living in an RV traveling along the west coast to where I currently am, in Tucson Arizona. I have typically start my day out reading email, posting to and replying to Facebook, and of course doing surveys on Mturk. 
During the day, either going shopping or going on hikes with our Golden Doodle or doing maintenance on the RV. 
Evenings are usually spent watching a show or two on the Discovery Channel. 
I think the most enjoyable thing we did was visit a very touristy community south of us, where my partner and I did some shopping and had a nice leisurely lunch.

"Really all my values boil down to ""be kind"".  As long as I am kind to others and do what I can to help out and show that I care to all of my friends then I feel that I have done my duty both as a human and as a friend.  There is no sense in being unkind to anyone no matter how you feel about their life choices.  Just be kind.  Everyone is equally human and no one can control what race/ gender/ sexual orientation they are born as.  So why waste any time being intentionally mean?  I mean sure I've had days where I have been less than.  I always go back and apologize and make up for my wrong doings and move on with those people I was unkind to.  I have a very good friend who I met online and he just came out as identifying as transgender and would prefer for everyone to refer to them as he/them.  So of course I agree and don't change the way I treat this friend.  Because even though I am referring to this friend as he now instead of she.  They are sill the same person who I knew before and as I stated before is a human deserving of kindness.","In the past week I have not done very much.

"My central guiding values deride from Jesus Christ and my relationship with Him. As God incarnate, Jesus came to Earth to show the world what God the Father is truly like. The depth of His love compelled Him to sacrifice His life on the cross in order to atone for the sins of the world. That compels me to obey Him when He asks me to have compassion for others and tell them of God's love for them and the salvation available to them in Jesus. It also compels me to give charitably to those in need. The love of Christ plays the central role in all my decision-making; it forces me to consider and then act on what is best for me, for others, and for society in terms of furthering the Kingdom of God, since this world in temporal, and the Kingdom of God is eternal. Therefore, my over-arching goal is to persuade as many people as possible to accept Jesus as Savior and Lord and therefore become citizens of Heaven, and saved from eternity in Hell.","Last Saturday I got up relatively early in the morning (as I do everyday), I went for a walk and prayed. I came home and read the Bible. Then I watched Tucker Carlson's program from the night before on the Fox News channel website. After that I had breakfast.

Lying causes you to be caught up in different webs that you cannot get through once you create so many of them. I also believe in never judging anything by its cover. This applies to both people and aspects. I have had many relationships that have turned out amazing with people I would have never expected to like because of their cover. I have also had ideas instilled in me that I would have previously rejected if I had not dug deeper than the cover.","Beginning a week ago, I got up in the morning like usual to wake my son up for school.

"The values that guide my life are honesty, integrity, loyalty, and hard work. I feel like you have to be true to yourself and represent yourself honestly to others. This is the only way to find true acceptance and invite true acceptance into your life, to ultimately establish the kinds of relationships and find the kind of success (however that is defined) in life.  Treat others only as you want to be treated and expect nothing else. Hold yourself to high standards and don't compare yourself to others, which includes having expectations. Do if for yourself. Find true relationships and hold onto them and work to keep them. Understand what it means to be a real friend and know that the payoff is not superficial, but it is beyond that.

My most important values are my belief in showing everyone kindness even if they don't deserve it. I believe that if you show kindness to people who maybe aren't the nicest it might make them want to show kindness back. I also believe in being as friendly with people as possible so that I can have the best relationship possible with them. I especially feel this way about the people who I have working for me. If I can get along with them and they can get along with me it makes my day to day life so much better. It also helps people want to continue to work for me so that I don't have to spend a bunch of time hiring new people and trying to get them to fit into the team. Another value that I hold dear is honesty. I don't believe in having to lie to anyone about anything. Having honest relationships makes me feel more comfortable because I'm saying everything and anything that needs to be said. It also allows me to teach my sons the importance of honesty so that I'm raising two little boys who I can be proud of.,"Last Friday, I went to work as normal and had a bunch of meetings.

Saturday morning, my wife and I had to get up nice and early so that we could shovel multiple people's houses. We shoveled our friend's house who were in Mexico and while we were there we borrowed their snow blower so that we could take care of my mother-in-laws house, my friends mother's house, and my house. After we finally finished shoveling I sanded and mudded my son's wall because I had to tear it all done the other week. The rest of the day was spent relaxing with my wife. On Sunday, we headed to my grandmother-in-law's house so that we could help decorate her tree. After that we came home and spent time playing video games with our sons. Monday was just another regular day where I had to go to work and then I came home exhausted, but I still took care of doing another coat of the mudding on the wall. Tuesday, I went to work and then after I got to have a game night with my cousin and her husband. We played Descent for hours it was a blast. Wednesday, I went to work and then came home to make dinner with my wife and then watch Rumble with my boys. Thursday, I worked from home so that I could get my booster shot and then my boy's got their flu and covid vaccine.

"One of the most important values is dedication to one's career/work. I believe this is important as this value informs how you approach both school and work, which will lead you to success and earning an income. This value is also important as it allows you to invest in one's passion, which is one's job typically. Another thing I value is financial responsibility. This is important as this is how you make sure your life functions smoothly, from saving for emergencies and retirement to having a house and a form of transportation. Another thing I value is making the most of free time. This is important as free time is a time to explore and learn about the world, develop your hobbies, and generally cultivate your interests outside of work. This makes the world interesting and provides additional meaning to one's life. These values allow you to meet the right people, care for those around you, and improve the lives of those who are engaged in similar passions as you.","I wake up, check emails and texts and on my phone, then get up.

"The most important and influential thing in my life is when I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord.  I was young at the time, but I knew I needed to have a relationship with God and that I could.  I was raised in a Christian home and my values and guiding principles come from having an active faith in Christ.  I get my values from the Bible.  That is why I am against abortion, etc.  I had an eight-year-old son who was diagnosed with bone cancer.  For almost two years he fought and struggled with it.  He had an amputation of his left leg, two lung surgeries, and at least a year of chemo.  Through it all, he kept a happy disposition.  He could find joy in life.  When a newspaper reporter asked him how he could be so happy, he replied, ""I know that Jesus will never leave or forsake me.""  He died peacefully at the age of 10.  That is the kind of peace and faith Jesus gives us.  He has promised to never leave us.  Although I don't understand all the hard things people go through and the difficult things in life, I can trust that God is sovereign and will make everything right soon.","I can't remember too well what I did on Friday and Saturday of last week.

On Sunday we drove half an hour to the church where I taught the Senior Ladies Bible Study class and then attended the church service with my husband.  After church, we had a Women's Ministry meeting where we ate lunch and discussed the issues of our Ministry to Women.  After that, we drove home and I caught up on my computer items and did daily chores and routines.  Several times this week we went to the store to get items we needed.  On Tuesday, after doctor's appointments and errands, we drove to KC to check on a car we wanted to buy.  We were there early and waited to meet him.  We ended up buying the car and I had to drive one car home, following my husband.  That was grueling!  I hate to drive, it was at night and there was a lot of traffic.  But we made it home.  On Wednesday we had an appointment with the Pest Control to put out bait boxes for mice.  On Thursday we received a portable dishwasher that we had ordered.  It was a very busy week.

"The main central value of my life is honesty. If more people were truthful, telling it like it is, the world would be far better off. People don't need things sugar coated, they want to hear things as they truly are. This doesn't mean one has to be rude or hurtful while being truthful, but it does mean giving an honest assessment.","A week ago, I woke up, took my dog out, and started working. Then I fed my dog and took her for a walk. I continued to work until the afternoon, when I took her out again. I started making dinner, ate, watched TV and went to bed.

"The most fundamental value that guides me is integrity. This stands as the basis for all of my other values, because without I could give up on my other values. It is to upmost importance to me that I am true to myself and adhere to my beliefs. There was a time in my life when I would maybe go against who I was, even if just for a moment, to be accepted or not stand out. Those days are surely behind me. When I think of all the times I wasn't true to myself, I never want to be like that again. Staying true to not only myself, but to the ethics and morals that govern my way of life have never been more important to me. Fairness is at the base of my values when interacting with others. I know what it feels like and means to be treated unfairly and I don't want anyone to ever feel like I am doing that to them. I put in as much effort as I can to be fair to anyone I am interacting with. There was a time when being fair wasn't as important to me as it is now. I don't remember too much about that time, but I do remember that when I started to feel I was being treated unfairly I didn't want anyone to feel that from me. I wanted to be somebody who took everyone into consideration and be aware of their unique situation. Whatever it may be. I would say those are the most important values that I hold the closest to my heart and am not willing to compromise.","Everyday for the last seven days I have eaten food, but only past 2pm.

I go outside with my dog sometimes, but only when he has to use the bathroom, because it's cold and I am not a fan of winter. I made a video for one of my social media accounts. It did better than what I thought it would so I think I'll make another one soon. I edited for about 2 days. I know why people pay editors so much money now. It's because no one wants to do it!

"Something that I will always live by is to treat others how I would want myself to be treated, although it is not always clear to me. I remember this principle because whenever I am not sure how I feel about someone, I try to think through and imagine how I'd want to be treated if I was in their place, and go from there. It's helped me throughout life to just stop and think before making decisions, even if they are everyday decisions. I believe that a person's habits really determine who they are, so I try to implement this in my every day life to make these behaviors habitual for myself. 

For example, I have had friends who were too afraid to tell me how they really feel about certain things, and it has only made things harder. The best thing to do is to just be straight forward without loosing control of your emotions.","Last week ago today was a Friday and a very busy weekend, I picked up my girlfriend from the airport and drove her and her parents home.

It was tiring but definitely worth it since she lives closer to me now. And they fed us so it wasn't bad. Monday hit and the work week started for me, busy schedule leading up to the holiday season. I needed to get as much done as I could before this upcoming weekend, because I will be once again busy with my girlfriend at her graduation party.

"The most important values that guide my life are honesty, loyalty, trust, fairness and virtue. I value honesty because it helps people to communicate with each other better. When people communicate, there are fewer misunderstandings. I also think society and relationships cannot function without people being honest. I also value loyalty. Loyalty is important in a relationship because we need to know someone will be there for us when times are bad. I want to know that I can trust someone to take care of things. Fairness in life is important because everyone should be able to share in the earth's riches equally. Virtue is important in relationships because society cannot function when people have low moral standards.

"My three most core values would be intelligence, compassion, and fun; if someone doesn't show all of these I will most likely not like them as a person.  For intelligence I can not stand an anti-vaxxer, science denier, or someone so idiotic that they believe JFK is going to return to life.  For compassion, I want to help those in need at any cost, as long as people are homeless, going hungry, or struggling to survive, we as a country aren't doing our job.  If I see someone miss treating someone, looking down on someone, or treating someone like a lesser human, it infuriates me and I will very likely step in.  Finally for fun, I believe that people put too much emphasis on work, some people make it the center of their life.  If they enjoy it then that's fine, more power to you; but to me work is work.  It is not the center of my life, and I find it sad that so many people devote their life to a company or business that doesn't care about them at all.

"The largest moral principle by which I live my life is to do as little harm to others as possible. I believe the world and life, in general, are already very cruel. We cannot readily predict when we will encounter suffering and, more often than not, we cannot tell if another person is currently suffering. In my life, I feel I have experienced an exponential amount of suffering, more than everybody I know, so I understand what its like to suffer in silence. Due to the unpredictability of the things that hurt us in life, I prioritize not being something that hurts others. I try to be as kind and considerate as I kind. I go out of my way to help others and make them feel joy if I can. This spreads to most of my other philosophies as well.","From the 10th to the 13th, I had a very basic routine that I was following.

These include grocery shopping, Christmas gift shopping and other things. On the 14th I had my college graduation.

"I believe in being honest with people. Not about tiny stuff that will hurt their feelings but about the big issues. I believe in doing what I can to make the world better, in small ways (I am a teacher and used to be an environmental educator). I have no delusions of making a big difference but small kindnesses matter. I think it's important that we listen to each other with a degree of civility even when we disagree. It's important to be gentle and patient with the disabled, elderly, animals, and children. It's nice to be curious about the world and share that enjoyment with others but it's not essential. If you can't say something good, or know you are angry, keep your mouth shut so at least you don't hurt anyone. Try not to judge others because you don't know what their life has been like and there but for the grace of the universe- it could be you.",I have gone to neurofeedback appointments in Cambridge for my extreme depression and anxiety.

I got up, ate breakfast, took a shower, did some last-minute studying, and took the final for three hours. This was a remote final, so I had to set up my space so that I would not be disturbed.

We went to Wendy's because it was a familiar drive, but I would have preferred to go somewhere local because I am visiting from out of state. 
Then, there were very serious tornado warnings. Tornados aren't really a concern where I was from, but this seemed very serious, so we hung out in the bathtub twice that night. We probably should have went somewhere on the first floor because we're on a second floor apartment, but we didn't really know where to go. The tornado just missed our area.

Without faith in God you can do nothing. Also kindness is important. A little kindness goes a long ways. I am kind not because of how it might benefit me, but because I want to see the dignity of my fellow humans. Another value is generosity. I try to give at least half my income to charity every year.","This week I have watched a lot of football. Football begins on Saturday with college football. I typically watch my favorite team.

"My basic philosophy hasn't changed since I was a teen. It basically goes: family first, friends second and everything else is a distant third. I haven't been motivated by material things as much as many others, and making money was never a primary goal. I've tried to support my family as much as possible, and since I never wanted children of my own, this meant devoting time to my parents, siblings and nieces and nephews. Since so many have died before me now, it leaves me somewhat lost. In the last few years, I have added a new guide for my life, which is to leave something of myself that friends and family will remember. My writing has become more important to my self-image than I thought it could become.","The past week has been uneventful.

"Some of the most important values I have are honesty, kindness, and to be humble. 
I believe being honest is so important, I feel so guilty even thinking about having to sugar coat or fib anything the slightest. As a kid I remember I could not even sneak into the movies when my friends would. I always had the worst self conscience about doing anything that resulted in my not being honest. 
I also believe in being kind, even when other people are at their worst. You truly never know what someone else is going through, so kill them with kindness!
I've always been a very humble and modest person, because once again, you never know what someone else is going through, and its better to just go with the flow than to rock the boat... even when you know better. I truly feel that it is better to be modest and take things with a grain of salt rather than start conflict. You will always know the truth and know better, so its better to just go with things than upset someone else.","Last friday (1 week ago) we went to my husbands work christmas party.

"My most central values revolve around kindness and survival. My childhood was really rough; I came from a house where I was abused in every way, and I witnessed an insane amount of domestic violence, crime, pain, and mistreatment. I decided early on that I was going to live a GOOD life — I was going to survive this, get out, and be happy. Aside from a huge amount of PTSD, I have mostly managed it — in the simplest terms, I formed my values by just doing the exact opposite of EVERYTHING that was modeled to me in my childhood, but more expansively, I’ve focused on happiness and kindness. I treat people the way I want to be treated (kindness), unless they treat me badly, and then I draw a hard boundary and I simply refuse to have anything to do with them (survival.) Obviously there are exceptions — coworkers that I cannot simply avoid, things like that — but by entering the world with both kindness and boundaries, I’ve been able to navigate most things successfully. I have struggles and hard days, but the gradual curve of my life has been upward since I left home, which is a huge deal — statistically, women from backgrounds like mine often recreate them, falling victim to domestic violence, addiction, murder, or suicide in adulthood, and Im living a life NOTHING like that. The other thing that has been a powerful force in defining my values (and I’m treating my PTSD) has been Buddhism — simple states, trying my best to stay in the now as much as possible.","A week ago — last Thursday — I was in bed ALL day because I was recovering from a really bad sinus infection and the antibiotics hadn’t quite caught up yet.

The last one is to always help others. I think these values help you find a fulfilling life by just existing. I am not religious so living by these helps me have a fulfilling live in the present.,Last Friday I woke up and went to work. I took a shower and brushed my teeth and packed my lunch and drove to work. I worked for 8 hours and came home. I made food and had dinner with my fiance.

"The most important values to me are integrity and honesty. Being honest with others and as well as their honesty with me is something I hold in high regard honesty and integrity.  Integrity to me is doing the right thing, especially when no one is watching. I feel it is very important and a way to walk a straight and moral path. Without honesty and integrity people would do whatever they want and hurt a lot of people in the process. Being honest is and always will be the most important thing to me. I believe in being myself, whether another person likes it or not. I am honest with them and honest with myself. I also believe in forgiveness. Forgiving another for the wrongs they have done allows us to get rid of the bad feelings they have given us. I may never forget what they did, but forgiving them allows me to move on.","For the last 7 days I have gone to work 4 times.

"My most important value is FREEDOM. There are many ways to look at freedom, and the most important of these for me is the physical ability to relocate away from a place that I do not want to be. 
That's why I thought my world had ended when states began mandating that, as the price of transportation, I surrender the ability to get up from a seat for the duration of my time in a car (with the Damoclean sword of maybe not getting it back after the duration). this  has been followed by surrendering the right to even adjust the degree of my confinement. Now, even the decision to get out of the car can't be made without the permission of the car itself.

I was raised in a tight family, so having that value is extremely important.  Another value that I have is sticking to things you love.  If you don't love your job, you are not going to be happy, so I always found that to be a good thing to teach my kids.  I think it helps to prepare you for life to have a strong family, and a drive to do something that you love.","I have worked out 5 days this week,  I have been off of work, because my kids had a stomach flu.  Earlier in the week I took my kids to their friends house, which is where I assume they caught the bug.  Most of the week has been MTurk and TV, while helping my kids get better at home.  Playing games until my husband got home from work, and having enough times to read the kids books and get them ready for bed after he got home.",4.5,1.1666666666666667,5,4.166666666666667,4.166666666666667,1.5,3.6666666666666665,3.8333333333333335,5.5,4,6,4.5,4.5,6,3.5,5,5.5,5.5,8,3.6666666666666665,4.5,3,1,29,1,english,1,5,R_W0Akl3IDbuvw4Jb
"The most important values that guide my life are adventure, knowledge, change, and family. As a queer woman coming from a pretty religious, misogynistic, and paternal family it is important that I achieve my dreams and that those dreams are outside the normal societal expectations. I have already traveled to more countries than anyone in my family ever has. I have been to all 6 continents and lived in New York City. Achieving this when all that was expected of me was to marry a man and have children and never leave my hometown, is very important. I continue to strive for change and adventure and will always do so. I also try to make a point of spending extended time with my elderly parents as much as possible because I know this time will be extremely important to me someday when they are gone.","Starting on Friday, December 10, I began a drive from California to New Mexico. It was a 13 hour drive. I stopped for gas a couple times and to eat lunch at Subway. I arrived at 10pm in New Mexico. On the 11th I spent the day with my New Mexico family. We drove around Santa Fe, ate brunch, got hot chocolate, and then went to their home to chat and make pizza for dinner. On the 12th we went to a arts and crafts festival in Santa Fe where my family sold their crafts. We were there all day. I bought some crafts. We went for dinner afterwards. On the 13th I drove from New Mexico to Texas. It took 9 hours with a couple stops for gas and lunch at Wendy's. On the 14th I watched TV and read and then met my family for dinner at a tamale restaurant. On the 15th I had a phone call with my best friend for two hours. Then I watched TV and read and had dinner. On the 16th I went to see a movie with a friend of mine at the theater. Later that night a family member came over for dinner and we chatted.

"The one guiding value... well, two guiding values that define who I am is being straightforward and honest when it comes to anyone I talk to or end up meeting regardless of the situation. I came to value this when I learned the hard way that lying only leads to more lies until someone ends up getting unintentionally (or intentionally) hurt in the process... plus I wasn't really a very good liar to begin with. Since those days when I was younger, I've really come to value when someone or something is being honest and straight to the point. It's a value that my family holds in high esteem as well, seeing as how they tend to practice it in their daily lives to the point where it is about as natural as breathing. Another thing I value is kindness, considering that I do my best to come across as that to those who are in need of that metaphorical light in their lives. There's far too many instances where people tend to close themselves off because of what they've been through, and the reasons are understandable... but after a while, one longs for some form of companionship, and it never hurts to start with meeting someone halfway who also wants a similar thing.","For the past seven or so days, I've just been going about a regular routine... or about as regular as it can be given the condition of the world that's still ongoing as I'm typing this. I usually wake up in the morning and start staring at the ceiling while contemplating on what I could do or get done today, and it also doubles as a means of getting rid of that half-asleep feeling. After that, I get out of bed and stretch my arms and legs before immediately opening up my laptop to continue what I was doing or watching the day prior to this next one. What I usually end up watching on YouTube is either video game things, stuff on old technology, old commercials that really get me reminiscing, or cooking in case I was feeling really hungry and waiting for some food to be heated up or made. Related to the video game stuff, it's usually reviews of games I already have or am currently interested in buying and just wanting a second opinion on whether it would be worth the investment.",4.666666666666667,2.1666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3,3.8333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,4.166666666666667,4.333333333333333,5.5,2,5,4.5,4,3.5,5,5.5,5,6,15,3.1666666666666665,3.5,4,2,25,1,English,2,4,R_2B2H2BT2fRjXunw
"More and more I find my main and most basic values revolve around not allowing this sometimes crazy world to make me act crazy. Particularly with national politics and everything seeming to get more extreme, I refuse to allow things to make me become more extreme. I believe extremism is childish and lazy. It also creates conspiracy theories, which are the antithesis of trying to live a reality based life. The far left and far right live in a fantasyland that I want no part of. I teach my children that extremism is not the virtue the extremes pretend it is, that maturity is dealing with reality. I also teach my children they are no better than anyone else and to treat everyone accordingly and to not stoop to the hatred spewed by so many.","My weekdays tend to pretty similar so instead of being repetitive I'll just give the basic rundown. Wake up then wake my children up. Get them cleaned and clothed and fed. Also feed the dog and take him out. My husband is pretty self sufficient so besides making him breakfast sometimes, I don't have to worry too much about him. I also shower and dress in between all this before driving the kids to school and driving myself to work. I work all day, meeting with coworkers sometimes and sometimes working alone. I often take a lunch break to go take the dog out and eat quickly. At the end of the work day I sometimes run errands or pick the kids up from after school activities before heading home to make dinner, make sure homework is done, watch some tv, and get everyone ready for bed before starting all over again.

My other value, is to just be compassionate towards other people (excluding family). I strive to be an understanding person and always give someone the benefit of the doubt.

"Ultimately my guiding principle comes from my belief in God. I try to live selflessly and love and serve others. I don't want to just live for my own comfort and pleasure. However, I often find myself living for myself. 

I recognize that life is temporary. Getting physical possessions is not as meaningful as helping someone else, so I want to live in a way that makes other people's lives better, not just my own.

This means we try to give to others and invite people over to spend quality time with others, rather than just living our own private, separate lives.

"The guiding principles of my life are difficult to define. I know that they center around my family. Although my family is small, my mother is probably who I think about the most, as I am her caregiver, and I need to make sure that she is never in need of something that I can provide. My children are the most important people to me, and I wish I spent more time making memories. But I know that I have held them close, and even if we haven't been able to travel and do things together that require the ability to leave an aging parent alone (or money), I know that I spend time with them at home.

Last Friday, I headed home, and we didn't really have anything good to eat, as I recall, so we ordered a pizza, as we normally do.

I think Saturday found me getting up and going downstairs to talk to my mom to try and take her out. She takes pain meds, but I think that she had taken them twice, because she was really out of it, and we wound up spending all day tied to the house. I was afraid to do anything because I knew she'd be mad that she couldn't go out and that I did. Except she was too dopey to go in the car.
Sunday found me pissed off at my mother, and so I didn't take her out and didn't feel bad about it. I stayed around the house on Sunday, cleaning my room specifically, and decluttering.

One of my most important values is integrity. I find it the most important because of how it impacts so many behaviors and actions in your life. Living with integrity allows me to feel confident in how I treat others and ensure that I feel good about my actions at the end of the day. I think that compassion comes in a close second. Compassion allows me to assist others in ways that I may not have considered and will propel my opportunities to put goodness in the world. I think both of these values are important because of how much we interact with people around us and the impact we have on their lives. Living with both of these values means that each person I interact with can walk away feeling positive and happy. I enjoy making sure that I am honest with each of these to ensure I live by my moral code.  Each of these three moral principles requires constantly checking in with myself to ensure that I am following them and making the best decisions available to others and myself.,"I normally like to wake up at a consistent time which is 7:30 A.M.

I started by waking up in the morning, after that I take the medication I have to take daily as soon as I wake up. I wait for my medicine to kick in and then I go down the stairs with my dogs so they can use the bathroom while I make coffee and a salad for my guinea pigs. After that, I come back upstairs, feed my pigs, and go to work on Mturk. Some days I clean the room and the cages to keep everything nice and tidy.

"I can boil down my values pretty fast. All the parts in the Bible that are written in the red ink and start with ""Jesus said,"" those are the basis of my life philosophy.  You have to add in a little Wiccan ""do no harm"" and some Stoic philosophy of finding contentment with what you have but it's pretty simple. I do my best with what I have to support me and mine, while not hurting anyone else. I also don't waste things if there is extra of something you share it or donate it.","Every day I get up in the morning and take the dog out. I see to it he's fed and happy.

This requires getting three different sets of clothes out her closet to play ""what do we think matches today."" After that we both have breakfast, eggs, toast, yogurt, coffee and juice. After that I put on her chair exercises. She never really does the exercises, but she waves her arms around and stamps her feet on the floor which I guess is some kind of exercise. While that's going on I move the laundry and M-Turk for a while before getting lunch together, generally, it's soup and sandwiches. She sleeps after lunch, so I have some peace to do the quiet housework and put away laundry.

On Monday, I woke up not feeling well so I decided to spend my morning on the couch, drinking tea. I started feeling better in the afternoon and decided to get some work done around the house. I did the dishes, picked up laundry from the bedrooms and bathrooms, and then spend time working on my jewelry making crafts.

"I try to live by strong values. I believe in treating all living creatures equally, including animals. This is the main reason I took up vegetarianism several years ago. I also believe in kindness. I practice this via teaching and my interactions with others. On top of this, I also believe in standing against those you think are wrong. If this means being unkind, I am okay with that. For example, if I need to speak up against an authority figure who has treated me poorly, I believe this is the right thing to do. 
I believe honesty is very important. I do everything I can to always be honest. I will never pretend to be someone's friend. I believe that life is too short to waste time on pleasantries with people you do not like. I like to save those kind words for those I care about and truly mean it. This makes it so people can always trust me because they know I am truthful, even with tough stuff.","This past week I went to work. I had some meetings after school for work since I am a teacher.

"Being “Born Again” was the most meaningful thing in my life. Nothing can compare to it.  I had not been aware of it; I was raised a Catholic, and those words were never mentioned.  The sheer joy in knowing that the Almighty God knows me is incredible in its self, but knowing that he accepts me with all my flaws and has a place for me in his kingdom is surreal!

The Bible guides my life and my decisions. Dealing with people, in general, is a cautious step these days when people are programmed to cancel you for one word or tweet you may have done years ago. Forgiveness isn’t in the Leftist/Socialist dictum. I try to see things from others’ perspectives often.  This helps with communication with different ideas that people have formed, right or wrong.  

God is first, NOT RELIGION. But, unfortunately, the two are often conflated wrongly.

Politics are important to me more than ever as the rise of evil in our lives has reached a dangerous point, and the FALL of America is in serious question!  

IGNORANT or EVIL?  Mass Genocide is occurring right beneath our noses! People are being kept in the dark; in the darkness, EVIL reigns.  The orchestrators of this madness are on a mission to rid the earth of useless mouths.

 The FEARMONGERING since this PLANNEDEMIC began has met with great success, both in America and around the world. But, unfortunately, fear is paramount when it comes to controlling the masses. 

They are trampling on our CONSTITUTION RIGHTS with ever-increasing boldness day after day; our freedom diminishes as the tyranny grows. 

The Demonic Quintet; BigPharma, Mainstream Media, BigTech, Government, Academia, and Satan himself, be it the personification Bill Gates, George Soros, or Tony Fauci if not possessed they are all certainly doing his bidding. 

Hospitals and many doctors are in lockstep with BigPharma by not only failing to provide Proven Medications that are both SAFE AND EFFECTIVE but instead administering drugs that are extremely ineffective and deadly.

"One of my central beliefs is that people must be dealt with consistently and fairly. I don't like the idea of engaging with people on the basis of preconceived notions of who that might be because of what group to which they might belong. When I meet a person, I am first and foremost meeting a fellow human being. The process of understanding that human being might be shaped by previous experience, but understanding can never be solely determined by previous experience.
I also believe that coercion of other people must be kept to a minimum. There are essential human rights with regard to self-determination of religion, speech, social attachment, etc.
I also believe that a fundamental good is obtained by helping other human beings. This is not always easy given the other values that I mentioned previously: There have been many well-intentioned people in the past who have tried to ""help"" others and who in so doing either violated the rights of others or who engaged in some form of patronization which pushed their own shortcomings onto others disguised as gifts.
I can only understand myself and grow if I allow others to come into my life and assist me in my growth. It is important to maintain one's sense of independence and individuality, but if that sense of independence becomes all-important, then I will become permanently isolated and ""stuck.""","Last Friday through Tuesday, I worked the late evening to early morning shifts at the grocery store at which I work. My life on work days is quite regular: I awake from sleep sometime between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. I prepare myself a cup of coffee and look at the news online and also look at Facebook to see what is happening with my friends and family. As a diversion, I play the game Scrabble Go on my handset. I invest in a variety of stocks and funds, so I often spend some time each day investigating market news and information. About two hours before my work day is to begin, I begin to prepare myself mentally for the workday ahead. I am a cashier at a grocery store. Retail is a difficult area in which to work at the present time owing to the increasingly poor public behavior evidenced by many. So I steel myself for the day by preparing myself mentally for what I might encounter, and by making myself as physically comfortable as possible. I make sure my body is well-hydrated and that I feel clean and comfortable before going to work. When I am at work, I try to concentrate on doing my job as effectively as possible. I try to be positive and upbeat with customers as much as I can. I am sympathetic and try to be helpful to both my coworkers and customers. I work hard at a job which is often repetitive and mentally unrewarding.
Once I drive home from work, I try to unwind and let the other parts of my mind find time to function. I am very interested in history and archaeology of late, so I often find videos on Youtube which relate to these topics. I also enjoy Scrabble, so I play Scrabble Go on my phone quite a bit.
I live in the snow belt, and last Friday we received our first major snowstorm of the year. I rent an upstairs suite of rooms with 3 other people and we are responsible for shoveling parts of the property. So, last Saturday I spent 2 1/2 hours shoveling snow. It is an activity I have engaged in for many years and I am actually quite fond of it. There is a sense of accomplishment to being able to look back at a cleared walkway or path after having shoveled it, remembering that only a short while earlier it had been a small sea of whiteness.
During my days off, I like to engage in long walks. This past Tuesday and Wednesday were consecutive days off for me, a rarity of late. On Tuesday I took a long walk and after it went to an Asian-themed grocery and purchased a prepared meal from its deli. This is a luxury for me. 
I also spend a good bit of time investigating my ancestry. I have taken a DNA test and assembled a family tree on a popular genealogical website.

"Writing about central values is more challenging than writing about everyday activities. I think that one guiding principle is to be nice to other people.

I think most of my guiding principles are about being kind and understanding. The Golden Rule is a good principle to live by: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If everyone followed this rule, the world would be a better place.","The last week has been fairly routine. Starting a week ago, I went to work as usual after having breakfast. Later there was lunch, then coming home and having dinner, then going to bed. It is hard to remember many more details from a week ago. Subsequent days were very similar, waking up and having coffee and breakfast, then working, having lunch, and coming home for dinner. One night I watched a movie at home, and another night watched some tv. Yesterday is easier to remember. One of my neighbors was outside working on their car, and I went outside to talk to them.

"The most important values in my life are respect for all life, inner peace, and humility. In my life, there are have been times that I have truly exceled at following these values, and other times that I have fell short. I will go through each of these values in more detail. As far as respect for all life goes, I feel that in all of my life decisions, I try to determine how other lives were or are impacted by my decisions. For example, I try to eat a vegetarian diet, and most of the time, eat completely plant-based. I do this because I know that animals that are sent to slaughter houses are not treated with dignity and respect in their last moments. By purchasing the meat, it means that I am supporting this behavior, and therefore am not displaying respect for the innocent animals that have been slaughtered. I also try to think of environmental impacts when I make decisions about what to buy. For example, before I buy anything, I always ask myself if it is something I can do without, something I can make, or something that I can buy used. Only if the answer is no to all of those questions do I buy something new. When I do buy goods, I try to buy as local as possible because it means less transport and therefore less carbon emissions. Inner peace is a value of mine because I feel that when I have inner peace, I can then emit that peaceful energy to others in my life. When I have inner peace, I am at my absolute best. I have infinite patience for my family, I make good decisions with my own life, and I don't do things like speed when I drive or honk my horn when I am annoyed at other drivers. I also find that I don't compare myself to others. I am just at peace in every way. Lastly, humility. Knowing my place in the universe is so incredibly tiny, spontaneous, and unlikely keeps me in check. My problems are so miniscule compared to many others, and also compared to the great expanse of the universe. Having the mindset that I am just a tiny speck of dust on a tiny blue dot floating in space keeps me humble and treating others with the utmost respect, and giving others my full attention.","Things that I have done in the last seven days. Probably the easiest way to do this in separate paragraphs, organized by different types of activities. I know this deviates a bit from the organization suggested above, but I feel like it is the only way I can do it. 

Once a week activities: I baked two loafs of whole wheat bread on Tuesday, and froze one of the loafs for use later. I also worked on planning my vegetable garden for the next season, and started a list for ordering from the seed catalog. In addition, I cleaned all the windows of the house, cleaned the bathroom, and meal planned for the week. I also grocery shopped. I also dropped off the rest of the Christmas cards to the post office. 

A few times a week activities: Every other day, I catch up on laundry, so each of those days I do at least one load of laundry. I also sweep every room in the house and vacuum all of the carpets. I try to work out a few times a week, so this week I did three days of calisthenics and squats. I also cleaned out the refrigerator a few times and organized the pantry. It gets messy quick with little kids around. 

Every day activities: I cook breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day for my family. My husband works outside the home during the week, but I am home to cook for my son every day. I also do the dishes every night, and clean the dishwasher out every morning. I check the mail, take my son to the park, and play in the backyard with him every day. I drink coffee every day, and feed and take my dog out to potty every day. I sit and drink tea and read every night, and have at least an hour of alone time with my husband every night after our child goes to sleep.",5,3.8333333333333335,3,2,3.1666666666666665,2.5,3.8333333333333335,3.8333333333333335,5,2,6,2.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,14,3.3333333333333335,3.5,3.5,1,32,1,English,1,6,R_1nZyIn8lvp4dv19
"I use the Bible, prayer, and the Holy Spirit to make the most important decisions and to guide my values in life. When it comes it difficult decisions there is only one guidebook to life that I know to be accurate and true: the Bible. I can go to it for answers for anything that I may have questions about. There is literally nothing new under the sun and nothing that cannot be solved by searching through the scriptures. I also depend on prayer and communication with God through the Holy Spirit to make my decisions. He is my guide and I can count on answers from Him that are correct and true when I have an important decision to make. These same values are shared with the people who are most important in my life as well.","Since last Friday I have been to practice for Christmas Cantata, baked cookies, baked bread, made dinners, done laundry, written three thank you notes, anonymously sent gifts cards to a person in need, called to cancel reservations at a hotel, made reservations at an Airbnb for next April's vacation, texted with my mom and sister, wrapped presents, watered the Christmas tree, vacuumed the floor, cleaned the bathroom, made copies for a meeting, attended a business meeting, taught a Bible study, completed an Advent Bible study, finished a book, made a phone call, delivered Christmas goodies to three different people, shopped for groceries, researched how to make a Hot Cocoa Bar.",3.8333333333333335,1,4.5,3.1666666666666665,5,4.333333333333333,2.1666666666666665,4.5,2,3,4,3,4,3,6,6,2.5,5,26,2.6666666666666665,7,3.6666666666666665,1,44,1,English,1,5,R_3L4FZgC5TlapUcw
"My most distinctive characteristic is my independence and originality.  I didn't have much of a family and was never ""raised"" in any particular way.  If I learned anything in youth it was to be distrustful of authority figures and only rely upon myself.  I have carried this belief with me into and through adulthood.

My values have changed over time.  I have become extremely egalitarian and politically active.  I find the United States government to be absolutely abhorrent in nearly every respect, regardless of which of the two major parties is in power.   One of my guiding principles is to elevate meritocracy above privilege or aristocracy.   We seem to live in a sort of kakistocracy, ruled by an absurd and indolent caste of unweaned adult sucklings who could not even pay their own rent as young adults, yet somehow presume the standing to opine on such things as whether or not this person or that person should receive health care.  

I think community is important but I am not a particularly social or sociable person.  Probably this is something I should work on in the remainder of my allotted time on our planet.","A week ago I was talking to my dear friend who recently left the hospital.  She had a mysterious illness that worried us quite a lot, and her condition is still perplexing.  It worries me a great deal.

Last weekend I relaxed at home.  Usually this involves playing video games, watching the Cleveland Browns, and playing chess online against some of the country's best rated tournament players.  I say this because I have no specific memory of doing any of those things.  I don't even remember which team the Browns played --- and yet I'm sure that they played and that I watched them.  Curious.

At work this week I was mostly involved with a new project, which is to install a customer relations management software.  The seller has a team to help us with that but their assistance is promised for only the remainder of the month.  We're operating under a deadline. 

I also have some routine tasks at work; e.g., managing my six employees, meeting with the occasional client.  On Wednesday I traveled downtown to meet with a judge and opposing counsel on a criminal case.

To take care of them, and my girlfriend, and to just survive in this capitalistic society, I have to work full time so I can afford shelter and food for myself and everyone else. That's why most of my days are taken up by my job. I also care deeply about my health, which is why I go to the gym most days of the week. Exercise has been proven to better pretty much every aspect of health. Plus, I just like doing it.","There isn't a lot of variety in my typical week since I am a product of a capitalistic society. Pretty much any given day (Sundays are my only guaranteed day off), I wake up around 5:30 am and make myself breakfast, usually bread with peanut butter if I'm still tired, or pancakes. I eat breakfast, and then spend a little bit of time with my girlfriend before she goes to work. I then go to the gym at about 6:30 or 7 am, and stay there until around 8:15-8:30 am. I get home, change, make a protein shake, and play with my dog for a little, and then I go to work. My work day starts at 9am and I get off at 6pm. Once I get home, I make dinner while my girlfriend and I tell each other about our days. We eat dinner, and then relax on the couch for a little watching whatever  we feel like watching on TV that night. At around 8pm, I take the dog for a walk. When I get home, I usually do the dishes for the day, and then we go to our rooms and get ready for bed.

"The most important values in my life are those that define me as an individual. By this I mean the things that I am and I want to be. So, specifically, this is being intelligent and analytical, being fair, being intellectual, being innovative and wanting to try new things, being artistic, and being active. I try to evaluate difficult situations by finding the actions that best accord with these principles. So, for instance, if I am faced with a decision that affects other I try to choose what is fairest and not what is best for me. Or if I need to resist temptation/make a decision as to what I want to do with my life going forward, I evaluate what will accord best with my values as above; a specific example of the latter would be when I'm struggling with eating healthily. There are many times I feel the temptation to eat poorly because of the short-term pleasure, but by evaluating what is important to me, I am able to resist the temptation.","Starting exactly one week ago I woke up, walked my dogs, ate breakfast and went for a walk in the earlier half of the day.

"Truth and justice come to mind first. They are the beacons in my life which guide me through the darkest times. In the current state of affairs they are more important than ever because society has lost all notions of either of these principles. 
If one is not true to themself then who really are they? Truth gives us a foundation to stand on and enables us to look in the mirror and be happy with what we see. Truth is something that while it may not be favorable in the end it attracts people to you because people want to know that a person is someone who believes in something and doesn't just pander and cater to whatever is trending. 
Justice is what nature intends. While justice is rarely seen these days the natural order of things still must stand on this principle.

I have to be able to trust someone in order to interact with them on a regular basis. Most people tell the truth most of the time, but most will also tell a lie if the benefits to them are high enough. An honest person will always tell the truth.

Loyalty is crucial for deep relationships in my opinion. When you commit to any sort of relationship, you are making yourself vulnerable, and if you someone isn't loyal, they will make you hurt.

"My central and most important values are guided by the saying ""To thine own self be true.""  I believe in living an authentic life.  I am always attempting to work through my conditioning and trauma to become the most authentic version of myself.  I believe in mindfulness.  I use mindfulness to help me get through difficult moments and to live in the present moment.  I was not taught how to deal with my emotions and that became a huge challenge when I became an adult.  I am highly interested in psychology and why people behave the way they do.  I've learned that this heightened sense of curiosity comes from the fact that I always felt hyper-aware of my mother's emotions.  She was not verbally affectionate and communicating with her was difficult as a child.  Not only was there a language barrier because she's from South Korea but she wasn't taught how to deal with her emotions either.  This naturally trickled down to me and I was always walking on eggshells around her mood swings as a child.  I had to manage her moods and this later became a strength and curse for me as an adult.  I'm a Myers Brigg's INFJ.  I have a very strong intuition and notice patterns in people automatically.  I had to learn how to use this as a gift rather than a curse.  It was hard to manage in my relationships once I got older but with conscious awareness and practice, I have been able to use mindfulness to use it to my advantage.","A week ago from today, I was working from home.

"I try to live by the oft repeated, but rarely actualized, motto of treat people how you want to be treated. I have seen many people in life treat others as if they are beneath them or owe them something, but when the time comes and they don't get the treatment they want they are upset. I think treating people how you would like to be treated is something that comes true because others see how you act. People can see how you behave and how you treat people, and if you are kind and generous they will likely be that same way towards you. I also know that if you are unkind or rude to someone, you should be ready to accept that same treatment back. How you treat people is a show of respect for other people and a show of respect for yourself as well. How you treat other people is how much respect you have for them and if you want this treatment back, how much respect you have for yourself.","This week has been a relatively quiet one for me, as I have been trying to avoid my interactions with others until I have gotten my vaccine booster shot.

"My most central values that guide my life are, my parents number one, and overall the teachings they have taught me over the years. For one, my father has always taught me to work hard and to work for myself, and that in life nothing is easy but it will take hard work and a lot of time. He has always taught me that there's always a solution for everything in life no matter the circumstances. If there are any problems in life, he has taught me that no matter how tough life is, that life will keep moving. When I have made some of the most difficult decisions I have always asked for his advice and has always been straightforward and pretty much everything that he has taught me in life has been straight forward. When I have dealt with difficult things in my life that is how I have continued life. I said ""Its happened there is nothing else I can do, life goes on"" An example of this, is for example, accidentally dropping my phone and it breaking it. It is replaceable. My father has always told me, ""everything IS irreplaceable, except life"". While we hold on to material things, every one of those material things will always be replaceable. But our very lives are not. These are the values that I have lived by. And the values are integrity, honesty, hard work, focus, patience, and straightforwardness. There is a solution for everything and in life. And there is always a better tomorrow.","In the past seven days, I mostly have been on my computer working, doing several Mturk tasks continuously with a few meal breaks in between.

I have also been watching random videos on youtube, and seeing what is trending or is there to see. During these meal breaks I also check the news. And try and see what future events are ahead.

My first piece of advice is to take the time to observe your mind from an outside perspective and simply be in the moment. That is what meditation is all about. But this isn’t an article about meditation.

"I remember being a baby.  I knew no words.  All I could do was move my head and my eyes.  Every once in a while I would see ""my"" foot kick and I'd think (not in words but in impressions) what's up with that?  Oddly my inabilities were not a source of consternation to me then.  After all I no idea what to expect from.  Having a body with physical senses was brand new to me.  I had a certain patience about the whole situaton, like All would be revealed in the fullness of time.  I loved to hear my parents talk in the next room though I had no idea what they were saying.   But I knew how to pray. And it was easy(after all if it were difficult it would be essentially impossible for me).  If anyone had taught me about God I wouldn't have understood them (not in words anyway).  But KNEW there was a God.  And the concept of a name or names was alien to me.  And in an especially anxious moment I turned to God in prayer when I noticed my mother wasn't coming to see me.  And he answered that prayer a few days later.  I was praying for my mother who (unbeknowst to me then) was dying of viral pneumonia (and that's why she didn't come to see me).  And (also unbeknownst to me) her doctor had given her an experimental medicine that would either kill her or cure her.  And (also unbeknowst to me) she came home an decided to take it and it cured her.  I only later found out these things from my mother decades later.  And she said ""And then I could come and see you again !"".  Almighty God is close to me.  And he loves me, and you, too.","I had spent 17 days in the hospital.  And 7 days ago I was sent home to recuperate from cardiac surgery (a new valve).  I have other health issues that I was so afraid would make it difficult for me to get out of the Uber ride.  But I became aware that the driver was a Christian.  So I asked her to pray for me as I got out of the vehicle, which she did.  Getting out was surprisingly easy.  And opening the lock with my brass key around my neck into a brass lock was also quite easy (perhaps a first for me because they tend to get gummy with corrosion).  I opened it up got her a tip and thanked her for praying for me as I believe so much could've gone wrong but did.  I'm rather poor and my insurance didn't cover rehab centers (I reckon) so they sent me home.  At first I was in bad shape (weak and sore) but happy to be home.  But my strength grew and the soreness faded.  Now my battle is with the bills.  (overcharging that should've been covered by Medicare A).  I been learning about the effects of a protein deficiency and about a potassium deficiency and well as how to prevent constipation (for a while there I wondered if I had an obstructed bowel, but by the grace of God I had a good movement yesterday (I think) after 3 weeks without one.  Sometimes I'm afraid that I might be overwhelmed by a sea of medical bills and lose my home only to die of exposure by the side of the road.  But all things do work together for good to them that love the Lord and are called for his purposes.  I don't know the future.  I have many abilities (by the grace of God) that might be useful.  For decades I've taken the security of this nation as a personal responsibility, not an organizational responsibility of mine.  I believe (perhaps out of vanity) that my abilities of strategic planning and new analysis and other things are so special, so refined that to subject them to a chain of command would diminish them.  Perhaps that's hubris.  Perhaps that's not God's calling for me.  But I know this much: no amount of cold hard math, no human skill alone, is sufficient to win victory neither in a modern conflict nor in ancient times.  Divine inspiration can fill in the gaps when the cold hard math falls short.  Perhaps the nature of conflict itself makes that inevitable, i.e. that victory belongs as much to the greatest prophets, the greatest seers and the greatest military.  Perhaps now as long ago conflict is as much about the journey of the human soul and the search for truth as anything else.

"Some of the most important values to me include responsibility, wisdom, liberty, independence, self-reliance, resilience, and self-reflection. I really try to gain a little bit of wisdom every day, and pass it on when appropriate. I take pride in being self-reliant and resilient, and that I am able to do things and make decisions on my own. I am proud of what I have overcome and how strong those things have made me. I live and breathe independent thinking, and try to encourage it in others, as I dislike being simply reactionary. I try to arrive at my decisions and opinions after thorough self-reflection and research, and tend not to follow crowds in most cases unless our values happen to overlap. Ultimately, I believe in liberty and responsibility, two sides of the same coin.

"One of my core values is accepting people without judgement, as much as possible. I value having a nonjudgmental attitude. This value has been important in my work as a child and family therapist. Counseling doesn't work well if the therapist is judgmental toward the client. This is crucial when working with teens. Teens pick up on any type of judgement quickly and easily. I have also imparted this value to my kids and they have grown into adult who are nonjudgement as well as people who advocate for those struggling to be accepting in society. I also believe in compassion. We all have our stories and compassion allows us to connect as humans, though we may be different, politically or culturally, for example.

I connect with my innerself and that flow state.","I started a new embroidery project. I have this oddly-colored paisly print cotton fabric. I put a scrap of it in a small embroidery hoop and decided to experiment with embellishing the design printed on the fabric. I started with a black fuzzy floss. It says wool on it's label but I seriously doubt it is real wool. For the price I paid it is more likely to be acrylic than wool. Also, I've never seen wool sold before as stranded embroidery floss. But I started with one strand of the black and followed the outline with backstitches. When I ran out of that strand, I tried doing the same thing with a brown sewing thread. . The black floss was thicker than the printed line I was following and it looked bolder and darker with the thick floss. The brown thread was not quite as thick as the line I was following. Also, the brown was lighter than the black line printed on the fabric. The brown complimented the warm red on the print and the off-white of the background.

"That one is easy for me.  You see, I had an afterlife experience, and even though I was resentful about having to come back for about twenty years, I came to accept the fact that I had to stay here for a reason.

Though the years, I have come across people who are either struggling with their faith, have lost or about to lose a loved one or facing death themselves.  I haven't really sought them out but when the opportunity arises, I love to share my story and assure them (straight from someone who isn't necessarily a 'bible thumper'), that we really do indeed go on to another level of existence after we leave our lives here, so they shouldn't be afraid.

I try to remind people on facebook, as I have hundreds of followers, to be kind, and morally kind and faithful to themselves and higher ideals.  So that is my mission now.","Well, I am retired, so I really don't do a lot every day. 

The big thing that happened in the last seven days was that 6 days ago, we finally got our furnace repaired.  It had been out for about two weeks.  

After that was taken care of, I have a cat that has a skin problem, so I have been researching ways to address it without continuing to give him the vet prescribed meds. 

I am disabled too, so most of my days consist of watching TV, cooking, taking care of my physical needs and doing these surveys to help round out my budget so my fixed income will be enough.

"The most important values that guide my life is Focus and Appreciation Being able to concentrate on a particular activity and give it our full attention. When you can “zero in” on a specific outcome, you will be successful more often than not. Refocusing your attention is all about adjusting your mental lens. Just like you can change the lens on a camera to make your target object more precise, the same thing can be done with your mind. Having the ability to improve your mind, improve your brain, and quickly and effortlessly adjust your focus on one thing will bring about the positive results you want to achieve.
Using the Law of Attraction, the primary advantage of being in the mental and emotional space of gratitude and appreciation is that it helps you to live in a reality where everything works out in your favor. You set it free to explore itself. In the silence, you begin to get the insights and the inspirations and make the connections that take you out of mind into consciousness, which is beyond reason. Being inspired, feeling gratitude, and appreciating life cannot be experienced if you are stuck in your mind.","The past 7 days, I really did not much. I worked 5 days a week.

You trust you boss, and company you work for. Along with a personal romantic relationship. A lot of relationships are built on trust and honestly. This is something that can be broken and ruin a relationship. Trust and honestly is something that I value and take very seriously in all aspects of my life.

"The most important thing to me is helping others.  The main way I do that is through my work.  I work as part of a commissions team, and part of my role is to make sure that the payments we make are accurate.  I spend many hours each day reviewing the data from many standpoints to ensure our payments will be as accurate as possible.  I make sure that the right amount is paid on the right deals in the right month to the right people.  It is a matter of pride to me and to my team, and a matter of trust between us and the people we pay.  I monitor our systems proactively to prevent issues from happening.

Another way that I help people is through one-on-one training.  Since our team works remotely, I tend to interact with my co-workers through video calls and screen shares.  Sometimes I share my screen, but more often I let them share their screen.  This way I can watch as they walk me through the process they are asking me about.  I can see what parts they understand and where they could use some help, then I teach them how to work through their issue - whether it's how to create a report or view to monitor their activity, or where to look to find the information they are missing.  By educating and empowering my co-workers, I am helping them to become more productive, and helping them to succeed, which gives me a sense of pride and purpose.","Last Saturday, my youngest son and I went Christmas shopping together.  I drove, and we went to a large mall about 40 minutes away.  We stopped at several stores while looking for a particular store which had apparently gone out of business, since we never did find it.  We got hungry so we went to the food court and picked up some food at Taco Bell.  The food court is right under the movie theaters, which put us in the mood to see a movie.  We headed upstairs and found out that the movie we wanted to see would start in about an hour. 
 That gave us time to take our purchases out to the car, then come back and get our tickets plus some munchies.  After the movie we stopped at one more store then headed home.   On Sunday, my oldest son and I went Christmas shopping. He drove, and we went to his favorite hobby shop, about an hour away.  Next we got lunch at Taco Bell (a family favorite), then went to a book store, then came home.   We sat by the wood stove and watched Netflix until supper, then he headed back to his house.  Monday through Friday I worked from my home office during the day and watched Netflix in the evenings.

"Having love for someone is a very important value to me. I love my family, friends, and my pets. Showing that love is important as well, so that the ones I truly care about can see that I love and care for them as well. Respect is another important value to me. If someone doesn't show me respect when I am giving it to them, it shows that I don't need this person in my life. It means that they don't care about me, so I shouldn't waste my time on them.","I have went to the store to get a few groceries. I have went to a job interview.

"Important values that guide my life, are god first in everything. Without him we would not even be here on this earth. Doing good deeds and treating others with respect. It's not good to get even with people when they do you wrong. You always have to think about the good in everything. Being respectful to your elderly people and always saying thank you and please. Going out of your way once and a while helping out a stranger that you don't know. You never know what something as simple as paying for someones meal, or opening a door, or giving them a compliment can do to someone. It could make their entire day. Having your heart in the good is always a plus.","Over the passed 7 days I have been christmas shopping online and in store, wrapping presents that I have already gotten.

"One of my guiding values is simplicity. This simplicity extends from modest consumption to fewer but closer relationships. Simplicity as a guiding value can provide a lower stress, less competitive existence. This may sound simple in itself, but arguably difficult in the context of a consumer driven society, where more is better. Simplicity can be a good approach to lower consumption driven climate change; unfortunately, society promotes consumption and comparison.","Most of the past week is a routine of managing a child in my home.

Next day is here, Tuesday. Woke up early to bake cookies and wrap gifts for their teachers and for their white elephant gift exchange. Drama is a little over an hour drive so we, two boys, mother-in-law and myself,  left early, stopped for fuel and a quick lunch before dropping them off for three hours of fun. Spent the next two and half hours helping my mother-in-law get all of her Christmas shopping complete. After our final store we headed back to pick the boys up from their party and our hour drive home. The hour drive turned in to more like one and three quarters an hour due to an accident on the freeway. After getting home, changing clothes, wrapping one last gift and gathering the supplies we were back out the door for their Teen Night Christmas party, local home school group, I had organized at a community center in a town near us.

Having integrity is staying true to yourself and doing the right thing when no one is watching. I think it’s important for people to always act right. Kindness is treating others the way you want to be treated. If everyone did that the world would be a better place. Gratitude is being thankful for life and the things you have.

I believe that I have been blessed and I feel that I should use talent and give when I have the opportunity.  I believe that you should work hard in life because you work to honor God, people are watching and you represent your upbringing.  How you act and what you say is representative of your family, the company you work for or your household.  Another value that I live by is to be a good steward.  Don't spend tomorrow's prosperity.

Talking on the phone with my grandson about his wife being pregnant and how his life just went from being a college kid waiting tables to graduating from college, taking a job at a school this semester and a baby on the way. He just hit serious adulthood, discussing it at length with him is so much more fulfilling than creating e-mail campaigns for the company I work for.
