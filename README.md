On the right pane, under "Download custom model or LoRA", enter "TheBloke/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GPTQ:gptq-4bit-128g-actorder_True" and press download (this will download the model used in our studies. After loading completed, on the left pane under Model choose the model on the drop down menu. Under "model loader" choose "ExLLama" and click on load.
